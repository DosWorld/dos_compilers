<B>NEXT                     End Definition of FOR/NEXT Loop</B>

 <B>FOR</B> counter = <U>start</U> <B>TO</B> <U>end</U> [STEP <U>increment</U>]
 .

 <B>NEXT</B> [<U>counter</U> [,<U>counter</U>...]]

    Terminates the definition of a FOR/NEXT loop.

     <U>counter</U>    A numeric variable to be used as the loop counter. All
                numeric types are allowed, but the loop executes fastest
                if counter is an integer variable.

       <U>start</U>    A numeric expression; the starting value of counter.

         <U>end</U>    A numeric expression; the ending value of counter.

   <U>increment</U>    A numeric expression; the value by which counter is
                incremented or decremented with each iteration of the
                loop. Defaults to +1.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      <B>Notes:</B>    BASIC begins processing of the FOR/NEXT block by setting
                <U>counter</U> equal to start. Then, if <U>increment</U> is positive and
                <U>counter</U> is less than end, the statements between the FOR
                statement and the NEXT statement are executed. When the
                NEXT statement is encountered, <U>counter</U> is increased by
                <U>increment</U>, and the process is repeated. Execution passes
                to the statement following the NEXT statement if <U>counter</U>
                is equal to or greater than end.

                If <U>increment</U> is negative, execution of the FOR/NEXT loop
                is terminated whenever <U>counter</U> becomes equal to or less
                than end.

                If <U>increment</U> is 0, execution of the FOR/NEXT loop
                continues until Ctrl-Break is pressed (unless one of the
                repeated instructions itself increments <U>counter</U>).

                Note that changes made within the FOR/NEXT loop to <U>counter</U>
                affect the number of times the loop instructions are
                executed; changes made to <U>start</U>, <U>end</U>, and <U>increment</U>,
                however, do not have this effect.

                There must be one and only one NEXT statement for each FOR
                statement. Inclusion of <U>counter</U> in the NEXT statement is
                optional; if <U>counter</U> is omitted, its value is assumed to
                be that of <U>counter</U> in the most recent FOR statement.

                FOR/NEXT loops may be nested within one another. Each FOR
                must be given a unique <U>counter</U> value and each nested FOR
                must have its NEXT statement appear within the enclosing
                FOR-NEXT block.

                Nested loops that have a common termination point may use
                a single NEXT statement with values of <U>counter</U> matching
                the values for each FOR statement.
