<B>               Command-Line Switches and Compiler Options</B>

 <B>Command-line syntax:</B>

 <B>QB [</B><U>source</U><B>] [/b] [/g] [/l</B><U>library</U><B>]] [c:</B><U>buffsize</U><B>] [</B><U>options</U><B>] [/cmd</B><U>string</U><B>]</B>

      <U>source</U>    A source code file that's loaded when QB is invoked.

          <B>/b</B>    Turns off the color burst. For use with composite displays
                attached to CGAs.

          <B>/g</B>    Turns off snow suppression. Produces faster screen update,
                but may also produce snow. Has no effect on screens
                attached to Monochrome Display Adapters or EGAs.

<B>   /l</B><U>library</U>    Loads a specified user library. The argument <U>library</U>
                defaults to USERLIB.EXE.

  <B>c:</B><U>buffsize</U>    Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer for receiving
                communications data. Default: 256 bytes, maximum: 32767
                bytes. The transmit buffer is fixed at 128 bytes.

     <U>options</U>   Specifies one or more compiler options. See below.

  /<B>cmd</B><U>string</U>    Passes arguments at run time to a memory-compiled program.
                Everything from /cmd to the carriage return is accessible
                via the COMMAND$ function.

 <B>Compiler options</B>

          <B>/d</B>    <U>Debug</U>. Generates code that checks for arithmetic overflow,
                array bounds, RETURNs without GOSUBs, and Ctrl-Break. Also
                produces line number references for runtime errors and
                enables the use of TRON and TROFF.

          <B>/e</B>    <U>On Error</U>. For use when the program includes one or more ON
                ERROR GOTO linenumber constructions.

        <B>/MBF    </B><U>Microsoft Binary Format</U>. Designed to be used with the math
                coprocessor version of QuickBASIC, /MBF reads data in
                files stored via previous versions of BASIC and converts
                it from Microsoft Binary Format to IEEE floating-point
                format. The files are converted as they are read in, and
                reconverted to MBF as they are written back to disk. An
                alternative to the use of CVSMBF and CVDMBF, the /MBF
                option allows you to preserve your original data files, so
                they may be accessed on machines without coprocessors.

          <B>/o</B>    <U>Obj(BCOM.LIB)</U>. Produces an object file linked with
                selected routines from BCOM.LIB, instead of with BRUN.LIB.
                Programs compiled in this manner are likely to use less
                RAM and run faster, but take up more disk space. CHAIN and
                COMMON are not supported by BCOM.LIB. For more
                information, see Appendix D of the QuickBASIC manual.

          <B>/q</B>    <U>Speed</U>. Optimizes for fast execution at the expense of
                program size.

          <B>/r</B>    <U>Arrays in Row Order</U>. Instructs the compiler to store
                arrays in row order, so that, for example, ARRAY(2,1)
                would be followed by ARRAY(2,2) instead of by ARRAY(3,1).
                The compiler's (and the interpreter's) default storage is
                in column order.

          <B>/s</B>    <U>Turns off the Minimize String Data option</U>. By default, the
                compiler references duplicate string literals at the same
                memory location, in order to minimize storage
                requirements. That requires it to keep all strings in
                memory throughout compilation. Some programs with large
                numbers of strings may cause memory overflow errors as a
                result. The /s option turns off this default.

          <B>/v</B>    <U>Checking Between Statements</U>. Enables event trapping, with
                checking after each statement instead of after each
                program line.

          <B>/w</B>    <U>Event Trapping</U>. Enables event trapping, with checking
                after each program line.

          <B>/x</B>    <U>Resume Next</U>. For use with programs that contain one or
                more RESUME, RESUME NEXT, or RESUME 0 statements.
