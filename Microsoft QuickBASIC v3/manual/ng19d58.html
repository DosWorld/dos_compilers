<B>LPRINT                   Output to LPT1:</B>

 <B>LPRINT</B> [<U>exprlist</U>] [; | ,]

    Prints one or more numeric or string expressions at LPT1:.

    <U>exprlist</U>    Numeric and/or string expressions to print. Each
                expression must be separated from the one after it by
                either a comma or a semicolon.

           ;    If included at the end of the statement, suppresses the
                usual carriage return and line feed.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      <B>Notes:</B>    LPRINT with no argument sends a carriage return-line feed
                pair.

                QuickBASIC divides the output field into zones of 14
                character positions. If an expression is followed by a
                comma, QuickBASIC prints the next expression at the
                beginning of the next zone. If an expression is followed
                by a semicolon or space character, QuickBASIC prints the
                next expression directly after the previous one.

                If the last expression in the list to be displayed is
                followed by a comma, a semicolon, SPC, or TAB, QuickBASIC
                spaces appropriately and suppresses the carriage return-
                line feed pair. Otherwise, QuickBASIC issues a carriage
                return and line feed after executing an LPRINT statement.

                QuickBASIC assumes a maximum line length of 80 characters,
                unless a different value has been specified by means of a
                WIDTH "LPT1:" statement. QuickBASIC sends a carriage
                return-line feed pair when the maximum line length has
                been reached. Therefore, for example, if you LPRINT an 80-
                character string (and do not follow the string expression
                with a semicolon), you will get two carriage return-line
                feed pairs.
