<B>INKEY$                   Most Recent Character at Keyboard</B>

<U>s$</U> = <B>INKEY$</B>

    Returns, without echo, the character most recently entered into the
    keyboard buffer, or a null string if no character is pending.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      <B>Notes:</B>    The system variable INKEY$ must be assigned to an ordinary
                string variable before it can be used in a BASIC
                statement.

                If the most recent character is one of the 255 IBM ASCII
                characters, INKEY$ returns that character only. If the
                most recent character is a "special" character--a function
                key or a cursor keypress, for example--INKEY$ returns a
                two-byte string; the first byte is 00h, and the second
                byte is the extended code corresponding to the key
                pressed.

                If a key defined with the KEY statement is pressed, then
                INKEY$ will return with the sequence of characters mapped
                to the key as if the characters had been entered
                independently.

                Cursor control keys, such as TAB and BACKSPACE, will be
                returned to INKEY$ without processing (in "raw" mode).

                The following keys have special functions and will not be
                returned through INKEY$:

                    Ctrl-Break          Terminates the program unless the
                                        Keyboard break option in the
                                        Options menu was turned off.
                    Ctrl-Alt-Del        Resets the computer system.
                    Ctrl-NumLock        Suspends the system.
                    Shift-PrtScrn       Prints the current screen display.
