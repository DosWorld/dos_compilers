<B>      How BASIC converts data from one precision to another</B>

   1. If a variable of one type is assigned to a variable of
      another, the data takes on the precision of the target
      variable.

   2. When a higher-precision value (constant or variable) is
      assigned to a variable of lower precision, the value is
      rounded, rather than truncated.

   3. When a lower-precision value (constant or variable) is
      assigned to a higher-precision variable, its accuracy is
      limited to that of the lower-precision value.

   4. When an expression is evaluated, all operands are converted
      to the same level of precision--that of the
      highest-precision operand in the expression.
