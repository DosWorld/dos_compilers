<B>DIM                      Dimension Array(s)</B>

 <B>DIM</B> [SHARED] <U>variable</U>(<U>subscripts</U>)[,<U>variable</U>(<U>subscripts</U>)]...

    Defines the maximum subscript numbers for and allocates storage for
    one or more arrays.

      SHARED    An optional attribute. Arrays DIMensioned in a main
                program as SHARED may be shared with all subprograms that
                are compiled with that main program.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      <B>Notes:</B>    Arrays with a maximum subscript of 10 may be used without
                a DIM statement. Arrays with subscripts larger than 10
                must be DIMensioned before they are used.

                The first element of an array is element 0, unless the
                OPTION BASE statement has been used to change the starting
                element from 0 to 1.

                Static arrays may not be redimensioned. Dynamic arrays may
                be redimensioned after an ERASE statement or by means of a
                REDIM statement.

                A DIM for a dynamic array is an executable statement and
                must appear after any COMMON statements.

                The compiler does not perform bounds checking on array
                usage unless the program is compiled with the /d (debug)
                option.

                The maximum number that can be DIMensioned in a DIM
                statement is 63.
