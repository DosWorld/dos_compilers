<B>CLS                      Clear Screen</B>

 <B>CLS</B> [0 | 1 | 2]

    Clears the screen, as described below, and returns the cursor to the
    Home position (row 1, column 1).

           0    CLS 0 clears all text and graphics.

           1    CLS 1 clears just the graphics viewport, if a VIEW
                statement has been issued. If no VIEW statement has been
                issued, CLS 1 clears the entire screen.

           2    CLS 2 clears just the text window. The bottom screen line
                (line 25 or line 43) is left unchanged.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      <B>Notes:</B>    CLS with no argument clears the entire screen, unless a
                VIEW statement has been used to create a viewport in
                graphics mode--in which case CLS clears only the current
                viewport.

                CLS resets the "last point referenced" (LPR) so that the
                next graphics command that uses the STEP option references
                the center of the screen.

                In text mode, CLS clears the active page to the background
                color. In graphics mode, CLS clears the entire screen
                buffer to the background color.

                Other ways to clear the screen include SCREEN, WIDTH, and
                Ctrl-Home.
