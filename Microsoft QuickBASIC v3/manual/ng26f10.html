<B>PRINT #                  Output to Sequential File</B>

 <B>PRINT</B> <B>#</B><U>filenum</U>, [<U>exprlist</U>] [;]

    Writes to a specified disk file an image of what would be displayed on
    screen by a corresponding PRINT statement.

     <U>filenum</U>    The number under which the file was opened for output.

    <U>exprlist</U>    Numeric and/or string expressions to print. Each
                expression must be separated from the one after it by
                either a comma or a semicolon.

           ;    If included at the end of the statement, suppresses the
                usual carriage return and line feed.

      <B>Notes:</B>    PRINT # outputs exactly the same characters that would
                appear on screen in response to a PRINT statement. Commas
                between expressions, for example, result in the insertion
                of space.

                If an expression to be output contains significant quote
                marks or commas, you should surround it with quote marks
                by means of CHR$(34); otherwise, when you input these
                fields, QuickBASIC will interpret the significant commas
                or quotes as delimiters.
