<B>$INCLUDE                 Include File</B>

 <B>REM</B> <B>$INCLUDE:</B> <U>filespec</U>

    Causes compilation to branch to a specified text file, then return to
    the main file when the end of the $INCLUDE file has been reached.

    <U>filespec</U>    A string literal that follows DOS file-naming conventions.
                The argument must be enclosed within single quote marks.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

      <B>Notes:</B>    If the include file was created with the BASIC
                Interpreter, it must be saved in ASCII format.

                The include file must not contain END statements.

                Variables in the $INCLUDE file must be consistent with
                those in the main program.
