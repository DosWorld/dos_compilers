<B>PEN                      Enable/Disable Pen Read and Trap           Statement</B>

 <B>PEN</B> {ON | OFF | STOP}

    Enables or disables the PEN function (which returns light pen status
    information. Also enables or disables trapping of light pen activity.

          ON    Enables reading of the light pen status, via the PEN
                function, and causes QuickBASIC to check for light pen
                activity.

         OFF    Disables reading of the light pen status and causes
                QuickBASIC not to check for light pen activity. This is
                the default condition.

        STOP    Disables reading of the light pen status and deactivates
                trapping, but QuickBASIC continues checking to see if the
                pen has been activated. If it has, a subsequent PEN ON
                results in an immediate trap (provided an ON PEN statement
                with a nonzero line number has been executed).

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

      <B>Notes:</B>    If the "Checking Between Statements" option is in effect,
                QB checks for light pen activity after each statement. If
                the "Event Trapping" option is selected, QB checks after
                each new program line. If neither option is selected, no
                trapping takes place.

                For command-line compilation, /v enables checking after
                each statement, and /w enables checking after each new
                line. If neither switch is used, no trapping takes place.
