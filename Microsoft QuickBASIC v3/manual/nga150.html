<B>COMMON                   Pass Variables to CHAINed Program or Subprogram</B>

 <B>COMMON</B> [SHARED] [/<U>blockname</U>/] <U>varlist</U>

    Passes variables to a chained-to program or a subprogram.

      SHARED    An optional attribute. The COMMON statement must appear in
                both the calling program and the chained-to program or
                subprogram--unless the subprogram is in the same module as
                the calling program and the SHARED attribute is used in
                the calling program's COMMON statement.

   <U>blockname</U>    Any valid BASIC identifier; the first 31 characters are
                significant. Allows you to name a group of common
                variables. A group of variables passed with a <U>blockname</U> is
                called a named COMMON block; variables passed without a
                <U>blockname</U> are called a blank COMMON block.

     <U>varlist</U>    One or more scalar or array variables to be shared with a
                chained-to program or a subprogram.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      <B>Notes:</B>    The order in which variables appear in <U>varlist</U> is
                significant, not the names of the variables. To avoid type
                mismatches and other calamities, it's advisable to put all
                shared variables in a COMMON statement in a separate file,
                then $INCLUDE that file in both the calling program and
                any chained-to programs or subprograms.

                The COMMON statement must appear before any executable
                statements. Nonexecutable statements are CONST, DATA,
                COMMON, DEFtype, DIM (for static arrays), OPTION BASE,
                comments, and metacommands.

                If a static array is to be passed to a chained-to program
                or subprogram, its DIM statement must appear before the
                COMMON statement. The DIM statement must use integer-
                constant subscripts.

                If a dynamic array is to be passed, it must be DIMmed or
                REDIMmed after the COMMON statement.

                When passing a named COMMON block to a program in the user
                library, the calling program may not redefine the block to
                a larger size. Blank COMMON blocks may be resized.

                When COMMON is used with CHAIN and compilation is done
                outside the QuickBASIC environment, the BRUN20.EXE library
                (QB's default) must be used.
