<B>FIELD                    Allocate Space for Random File Variables</B>

 <B>FIELD</B> [#]<U>filenum</U>, <U>fieldwidth</U> <B>AS</B> <U>stringvar</U> [,<U>fieldwidth</U> AS <U>stringvar</U>]...

    Allocates storage for any number of string variables, each of
    specified character width, to be used in conjunction with a specified
    random file buffer.

     <U>filenum</U>    The number under which the file was OPENed.

  <U>fieldwidth</U>    The number of character positions to be allotted to
                <U>stringvar</U>.

   <U>stringvar</U>    A string variable to be used for random access.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      <B>Notes:</B>    Once the random file has been FIELDed, data may be
                extracted from the random file buffer after a GET
                statement or placed into the buffer in preparation for a
                PUT statement.

                A string variable defined by means of the FIELD statement
                points to a specified position in the random file buffer.
                It should not thereafter be used as an INPUT variable or
                on the left side of an assignment statement. Doing either
                of these things will point the variable name into the
                string space and remove it from the file buffer.

                Multiple field definitions for a given random file buffer
                are permitted. Each new FIELD statement starts again at
                the first character position of the buffer, and all FIELD
                statements for a given random file are in effect
                simultaneously. All FIELD definitions are removed when a
                file is CLOSEd.

                QuickBASIC resets all FIELDed variables to null when the
                associated file is CLOSEd or RESET. (In interpreted BASIC,
                such variables retain their last assigned values.)
