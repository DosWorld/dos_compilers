<B>CHAIN                    Transfer to Another Program</B>

 <B>CHAIN</B> <U>filespec</U>

    Transfers control to another program.

    <U>filespec</U>    A string expression that follows DOS file naming
                conventions; If no extension is supplied, an extension of
                .EXE is assumed.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

      <B>Notes:</B>    If the calling program and the chained-to program are both
                compiled with the default library, BRUN20.LIB, variables
                may be passed to the chained-to program via COMMON, and
                files opened by the calling program remain open to the
                CHAINed program.

                The alternate library, BCOM20.LIB does not support COMMON,
                and in programs compiled with BCOM20.LIB, a CHAIN
                statement is equivalent to a RUN statement (i.e., open
                files are closed before the CHAINed program is executed).

                Note the following differences between QuickBASIC and the
                BASIC interpreter:

                1.  The interpreter assumes a .BAS extension for the
                    chained-to <U>filespec</U>; QuickBASIC assumes .EXE. The only
                    explicit <U>filespec</U> extension allowed in QuickBASIC is
                    .EXE.

                2.  QuickBASIC does not support the ALL, MERGE, DELETE,
                    and <U>line</U> options of the interpreted BASIC CHAIN
                    statement.
