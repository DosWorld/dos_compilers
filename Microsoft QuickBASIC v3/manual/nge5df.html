<B>DRAW                     Draw Object</B>

 <B>DRAW</B> <U>string</U>

    Draws an object according to instructions specified as a string
    expression.

      <U>string</U>    A string expression containing commands in the BASIC
                graphics definition language.

    <B>Graphics Definition Language</B>

    In the movement instructions below, <U>n</U> specifies a distance to move.
    The number of pixels moved is equal to <U>n</U> multiplied by the current
    scaling factor, which is set by the S command.

          U<U>n</U>    Move up.

          D<U>n</U>    Move down.

          L<U>n</U>    Move left.

          R<U>n</U>    Move right.

          E<U>n</U>    Move diagonally up and right.

          F<U>n</U>    Move diagonally down and right.

          G<U>n</U>    Move diagonally down and left.

          H<U>n</U>    Move diagonally up and left.

        M<U>x</U>,<U>y</U>    Move to coordinate <U>x</U>,<U>y</U>. If <U>x</U> is preceded by a + or -, the
                movement is relative to the last point referenced (LPR).

           B    A prefix command. Next movement command moves but doesn't
                plot.

           N    A prefix command. Next movement command moves, but returns
                immediately to previous point.

          A<U>n</U>    Set angle. <U>n</U> may be 0, for 0 degrees; 1, for 90 degrees;
                2, for 180 degrees; or 3, for 270 degrees. Rotated figures
                are rescaled to adjust to the CGA's 4/3 aspect ratio.

         TA<U>n</U>    Turn angle. <U>n</U> may range from -360 degrees to +360 degrees.
                Positive values cause counterclockwise rotation; negative
                values cause clockwise rotation.

          C<U>n</U>    Set color to <U>n</U>.  The default color for medium-resolution
                is 3; high-resolution default color is 1.  See PALETTE for
                a list of legal colors.

          S<U>n</U>    Set scale factor. <U>n</U> may range from 1 to 255. The scaling
                factor used is <U>n</U>/4. The default for <U>n</U> is 4.

P<U>paint</U>,<U>boundary</U> Fill figure color to <U>paint</U>, stopping at areas of color
                <U>boundary</U>.  See PALETTE for a list of legal colors.

"=" + VARPTR$(<U>var</U>)
                Get argument from variable. May be used to supply
                arguments to any of the foregoing commands.

"X" + VARPTR$(<U>stringvar</U>)
                Execute command sequence stored in a string variable. This
                command allows you to call graphics-language subroutines.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------

      <B>Notes:</B>    To get arguments or instructions from variables, you must
                use VARPTR$(<U>var</U>) or VARPTR$(<U>stringvar</U>). QuickBASIC does
                not support the =<U>variable</U>; and X<U>stringvar</U> formulations
                available with the Interpreter.

                Spaces between or within instructions are insignificant.

                Semicolons may be used between commands to enhance
                readability.

                The drawing begins at the last point referenced (LPR) and
                LPR is updated as the object is being drawn.
