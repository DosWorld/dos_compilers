<B>ENVIRON                  Modify Environment Table</B>

 <B>ENVIRON</B> <U>stringexpr</U>

    Adds a statement to or deletes a statement from the current
    environment table.

     <U>stringexpr</U>     A string expression of the form "<U>name</U> = <U>parameter</U>".

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      <B>Notes:</B>    If <U>name</U> already exists in the environment table, its
                current setting is replaced with the new setting. If <U>name</U>
                does not exist, the new statement is added at the end of
                the environment table.

                To delete an entry from the environment table, make
                parameter a semicolon (i.e. "name = ;").

                <U>parameter</U> is case-sensitive.

                The new environment variable added, deleted, or modified
                by this procedure will only take effect for SHELLed copies
                of COMMAND.COM that are activated after this statement.
                After the program exits, the environment table will be
                exactly the same as before the program executed, no matter
                what changes were made with ENVIRON.
