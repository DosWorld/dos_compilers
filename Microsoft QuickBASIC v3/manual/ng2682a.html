<B>PRINT                    Display on Screen</B>

 <B>PRINT</B> [<U>exprlist</U>][{, | ;}]

    Displays one or more numeric or string expressions on screen.

    <U>exprlist</U>    Numeric and/or string expressions to print. Each
                expression must be separated from the one after it by
                either a comma or a semicolon.

           ;    If included at the end of the statement, suppresses the
                usual carriage return and line feed.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

      <B>Notes:</B>    QuickBASIC divides the screen into zones of 14 character
                positions. If an expression is followed by a comma,
                QuickBASIC displays the next expression at the beginning
                of the next screen zone. If an expression is followed by a
                semicolon or space character, QuickBASIC displayed the
                next expression directly after the last expression.

                If the last expression in the list to be displayed is
                followed by a comma, a semicolon, SPC, or TAB, QuickBASIC
                spaces appropriately and suppresses its usual carriage
                return-line feed pair. Otherwise, QuickBASIC issues a
                carriage return and line feed after executing a PRINT
                statement.

                QuickBASIC also issues a carriage return and line feed if
                the display of a list of expressions reaches the character
                position specified by the most recent WIDTH statement (or
                column 80, if no WIDTH statement has been executed).

                Numbers are always followed by a space on the right.
                Positive numbers are preceded by a space, and negative
                numbers are preceded by a minus sign.

                If no list of expressions is supplied, PRINT just issues a
                carriage return and line feed.

                Note that QuickBASIC does not allow the use of ? as a
                synonym for PRINT.
