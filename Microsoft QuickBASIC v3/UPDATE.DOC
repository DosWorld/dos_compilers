This file contains a list of corrections made to Microsoft(R) QuickBASIC
since the last release.	 See the README.DOC file for corrections to the
manual and enhancements made to the product.  These enhancements include
error listing capability and IBM(R) Advanced 101-Key keyboard support.

(1)  With an IBM CGA card, and your display in screen mode 0, the active
     page parameter now works as it does in IBM BASICA and as it did in
     QuickBASIC 1.x.  That is, more than one active page is allowed.

(2)  With an IBM EGA card, the active page is now reset correctly upon return
     to the user interface after program execution.

(3)  In the user interface, inserting a word deleted from the end of a line no
     longer inserts two spaces following the word.

(4)  Palettes are no longer reversed on a CGA display in screen mode 1.

(5)  A program that accesses a user-library routine containing a RESUME NEXT
     no longer locks up the system.

(6)  Compiling a program from the command line no longer locks up the system
     if the disk is full.

(7)  Variables passed to user-library routines no longer produce spurious
     "String space corrupt" or "Out of data" errors, nor do they generate
     incorrect values.

(8)  The interaction between CHAIN, SHELL, and the DEBUG and .EXE options no
     longer causes problems.

(9)  Passing strings in COMMON that were defined in a FIELD statement no longer
     causes a problem.

(10) High-intensity colors are now options for the foreground color in the
     View menu's Options... dialog box.

(11) If an invalid CIRCLE statement was followed by a valid CIRCLE statement,
     sometimes both the valid and invalid statements generated
     "Illegal function call" errors.  This has been corrected.

(12) The compiler no longer has problems optimizing code written without
     line numbers and compiled without the DEBUG option.

(13) A problem with function-key assignments giving spurious "String space
     corrupt" and "String heap corrupt" errors has been corrected.

(14) If a loop contained a SHELL statement followed by an LPRINT statement,
     the LPRINT would sometimes fail after multiple iterations.	 This has
     been corrected.

(15) The PAINT statement no longer has problems painting figures in EGA
     screen modes 7-10 when there is a gap of less than eight pixels between
     figures and painting begins on a byte boundary.

(16) The BSAVE statement now returns the proper error message if there is
     no space on the disk.

(17) The STOP statement has been corrected to set the error stack level
     properly.

(18) The color of the screen is now restored properly after a COLOR statement.

(19) The LOCATE statement now properly handles the cursor.

(20) Variables from a QuickBASIC program compiled with the BRUN20 library
     are now accessed properly after a CHAIN statement transfers control
     to an assembly-language program.

(21) The SCREEN statement has been corrected so that the order of COLOR and
     SCREEN statements no longer makes a difference.

(22) An error could occur when a program containing an ON...GOSUB statement
     was compiled with the /w (event handling) option.	This has been corrected.

(23) The INKEY$ statement now works properly after an error routine traps an
     attempt to open a nonexistent file with the OPEN statement.

(24) After a character is printed in column 80 followed by a semi-colon, CSRLIN
     now returns the next line, as it does in IBM BASICA.

(25) Memory is no longer lost when the CHAIN statement runs multiple programs.

(26) Calling a user-defined function (DEF FN) within an OPEN statement no
     longer causes an error.

(27) Using the compiler's /w option and the EXIT statement within a batch
     file no longer causes a problem when the batch file is run.

(28) Integer division with a denominator of zero no longer locks up the system.

(29) Several memory-management problems -- including string-space manipulation,
     which in turn led to errors ranging from "String space corrupt" to a
     system lock up -- have been corrected.

(30) The combination of the SOUND statement with an OPEN statement that
     accesses the "SCRN:" device now works properly.

(31) Floating-point subtraction performed between two SOUND statements no
     longer causes an "Illegal function call" error on the second SOUND
     statement.

(32) A problem with the the substring form of the PLAY statement has been
     corrected.

(33) Typing CTRL-PRTSC in response to an INPUT statement no longer results
     in all characters typed being printed twice on the printer.

(34) Using a null string for a file name in an OPEN statement now gives the
     same error message whether the file is opened for input or output.

(35) The VIEW PRINT and CLS statements now work properly together.

(36) KEY(<n>) ON and ON KEY(<n>) GOSUB <line> statements can now be in the
     same FOR...NEXT loop and work properly

(37) A machine lock up could occur on an 80286 machine if a COMMON block had
     a single-precision variable as its first argument, the next statement
     modified the variable (as in "b=b+1"), and the program was compiled with
     the /O switch.  This problem has been corrected.

(38) When the Compile... screen was displayed, pressing the right direction
     key, the spacebar, and the ENTER key in the Program box (in that order)
     would result in an "Invalid file specification" error.  This error could
     not be corrected except by completely retyping the file name.  This has
     been corrected so that the cursor is placed at the end of the name,
     allowing use of the BACKSPACE key to correct the input error.

(39) The PPRINT utility now handles the metacommand SKIP[ :n] correctly.

(40) The PPRINT utility now works properly with line lengths greater than
     80 characers when output is directed to LPT1:.

(41) The editor could lock up if a CUT/COPY operation was attempted when
     the mouse was used to select text and the area marked for selection
     extended beyond the last line of code.  This has been corrected.

(42) An "Input past end" error could occur when using BLOAD to retrieve a file
     that contained a 1A hex character (Control-Z).  This has been corrected.

(43) QuickBASIC can now correctly handle user libraries larger than 64K.

(44) A DRAW statement containing a string expression and a very complex drawing
     string could generate an "Out of memory" error.  This has been corrected.

(45) A directory specified in a $INCLUDE statement could not contain an
     extension.	 This has been corrected.

(46) Addressing an array element using an invalid subscript, even with the
     Debug (/d) option set, could produce spurious or misleading error
     messages.	This has been corrected.

(47) The program INT86.ASM has been corrected to work with VARPTR.

(48) If the WRITE# statement is used to store characters in a random-file
     buffer (a variable defined in a FIELD statement), QuickBASIC now pads
     the record with blanks, as stated in the entry for the "PUT Statement
     (File I/O)" in the QuickBASIC reference manual.

(49) Local variables in a user library are no longer preserved across a CHAIN,
     and no longer result in a "String space corrupt" error.
