ReadMe file for sample AZTEC C programs

I have put a small number of AZTEC C programs in place to
provide something interesting to compile.

These samples include a fairly effective run length encoding and Text
Screen compression scheme that typically compresses a 4k textscreen to
less than half its size in a Binary File which I have dubbed a PTX file,
using a modified PCX (ZSOFT) algorithm and providing a 128K
descriptive header.

Program Synopsis:

TEXTVU   EXE  -   Screen Viewer and Batch File Driver   
BSV2TXT  EXE  -   BSAVED to Ascii File Conversion Utility
