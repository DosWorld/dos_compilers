            This file contains a list of corrections made to the product
            since the last release.  See the file README.DOC for
            corrections to the manual and enhancements made to the
            product.  These enhancements include error listing
            capability and explicit TANDY 1000 keyboard and IBM Advanced
            101-Key keyboard support.
            
            
             - With an IBM CGA card, in screen mode 0, the active page
            parameter now works as it does in IBM's BASICA and as it did
            in QuickBASIC 1.x.  That is, more than one active page is
            allowed.
            
             - With an IBM EGA card, the active page is now reset
            correctly upon return to the user interface after program
            execution.
            
             - In the user interface, inserting a word which has been
            deleted from the end of a line will no longer insert two
            spaces following the word.
            
             - Palettes are no longer reversed on a CGA in screen 1
            
             - A correction has been made so that a program which
            accesses a user library routine containing a RESUME NEXT
            will no longer hang the system.
            
             - Compiling a program from the command line would hang the
            system if the disk was full.  This has been corrected.
            
             - Variables passed to user library routines were not always
            handled properly.  Spurious "String Space Corrupt" or "Out
            of Data" errors, or in some cases incorrect values could be
            generated.  This has been corrected.
            
             - The interaction between CHAIN, SHELL, and the DEBUG and
            .EXE options could cause problems.  These have been
            corrected.
            
             - A problem concerning FIELDed strings being passed in
            COMMON has been corrected.
            
             - A change has been made to allow high-intensity colors as
            an option for the foreground color in the VIEW OPTIONS.
            
             - If an invalid CIRCLE statement was followed by a valid
            CIRCLE statement, sometimes both the valid and invalid
            statements generated an "Illegal Function Call".  This has
            been corrected.
            
             - Problems with the optimization done by the compiler in
            the case of no line numbers and without the DEBUG option
            have been corrected.
            
             - A problem with function key assignment giving spurious
            "String Space Corrupt" and "String Heap Corrupt" errors have
            been corrected.
            
             - If a loop contained a SHELL statement followed by an
            LPRINT statement, sometimes the LPRINT would fail after
            multiple iterations.  This has been corrected.
            
             - A problem in PAINT which occurred in EGA modes 7-10 when
            there is a gap of less than 8 pixels and begins on a byte
            boundary has been corrected.
            
             - BSAVE has been corrected to return the proper error
            message if there is zero space on the disk
            
             - STOP has been corrected to set the error stack level
            properly.
            
             - The color of the screen was not always restored properly
            after a COLOR statement.  This has been corrected.
            
             - The LOCATE statement now properly handles the cursor.
            
             - When a QuickBASIC program, compiled with the BRUN20
            library, CHAINed to an Assembly Language program, variables
            were not accessed properly.  This has been corrected.
            
             - The SCREEN statement has been corrected so that the order
            of COLOR and SCREEN statements no longer makes a difference.
            
             - An error could occur when a program contained an
            "ON...GOSUB" and was compiled with the /W (event handling)
            switch.  This has been corrected.
            
             - INKEY did not always work properly after an error routine
            traps an OPEN on a non-existent file.  This has been
            corrected.
            
             - After a character is printed in column 80 followed by a
            semi-colon, CSRLIN now returns the next line, as does IBM's
            BASICA.
            
             - Memory is no longer lost during multiple CHAINs.
            
             - An error occurred when a user defined function was called
            within an OPEN statement.  This has been corrected.
            
             - The combination of the /W switch on the compiler, when
            run from a .BAT file, and the EXIT statement in the batch
            file no longer will cause a problem.
            
             - When integer division was performed and the denominator
            was zero, the system would hang.  This has been corrected.
            
             - Several problems concerning memory management, including
            string space manipulation, which resulted in errors ranging
            from "String Space Corrupt" to a system hang have been
            corrected.
            
             - The combination of the SOUND statement and OPENing the
            device "SCRN:" now works properly.
            
             - Floating point subtraction performed between two SOUND
            statements will no longer cause an "Illegal Function Call"
            error on the second SOUND statement.
            
             - A problem with the PLAY statement, using the substring
            form of the syntax, has been corrected.
            
             - Typing CTRL-PrtSc in response to an INPUT statement no
            longer results in all characters typed being printed twice
            on the printer.
            
             - OPENing a file with a null string for a file name now
            gives the same error message whether the file is OPENed for
            input or output.
            
             - VIEW PRINT and CLS now work properly together.
            
             - KEY(n) ON and ON KEY(n) GOSUB phrases can now be in the
            same FOR/NEXT loop and work properly
            
             - A machine hang could occur on an 80286 machine if a
            COMMON block had a single precision variable as the first
            argument, the next statement modified the variable (such as
            "b=b+1"), and the program was compiled with the /O switch.
            
             - A problem existed such that when the Compile Option
            screen is displayed (using the editor), if the right cursor
            were pressed and then a space, an "Invalid File
            Specification" would result, which could not be backed out
            unless the filename were retyped completely.  This has been
            corrected.
            
             - The PPRINT utility now handles the metacommand SKIP[ :n]
            correctly.
            
             - The PPRINT utility now works properly with line lengths
            greater than 80 characers when output is directed to LPT1:.
            
             - The editor could hang if a CUT/COPY operation was
            attempted when the mouse was used to select text and
            extended beyond the last line of code.  This has been
            corrected.
            
             - An "INPUT PAST END" error could occur BLOADing a file
            which contained a 1A hex character (Control-Z).  This has
            been corrected.
            
             - QuickBASIC can now handled user libraries larger than 64K
            correctly.
            
             - A DRAW statement containing a string expression and very
            complex drawing string could generate an "Out of Memory"
            error.  This has been corrected.
            
             - A directory specified in a $INCLUDE statement could not
            contain an extension.  This has been corrected.
            
             - BREAK status is now reset correctly.
            
             - Addressing an array element using an invalid subscript,
            even with the /D switch, could produce spurious or
            misleading error messages.  This has been corrected.
            
             - The program INT86.ASM has been corrected to work with
            VARPTR correctly.  (See the README.DOC, Part 2, section 19
            for additional information concerning INT86.ASM)
            
             - If a WRITE# to a random file with a FIELDed variable,
            QuickBASIC will now pad the record with blanks, as the
            documentation states.
