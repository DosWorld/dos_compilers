Version 3.20 of IBM(R) PC-DOS contains a bug that can cause unexpected results
in programs that generate floating-point exceptions. This file explains how to
install a small patch in DOS to eliminate the problem.

It is especially important to install this patch if you wish to use the C
run-time routine signal with the SIGFPE parameter, since that routine does
not work correctly in the unpatched version of IBM PC-DOS 3.20. IBM Corporation
also supplies a patch to eliminate this problem.

Note that MS-DOS(R) Version 3.20 contains another, different floating-point
bug. The README.DOC file for this release tells you where to find more
information about installing a patch for that bug. If you use any version of
DOS 3.20 other than IBM PC-DOS 3.20 or MS-DOS 3.20, contact your hardware
manufacturer to determine whether the problem exists in your version.

You can install the DOS patch for IBM PC-DOS 3.20 by following these steps:

    1.	Format a blank floppy disk. (Do NOT use the /s formatting option to
	transfer system files to the disk.)

    2.	Use the SYS command to copy the files IBMDOS.COM and IBMBIO.COM to
	the new disk. For example, if you boot from drive C:, you could use
	these commands:

	C:
	SYS A:

    3.	Use the COPY command to copy the files COMMAND.COM, SYS.COM,  and
	DEBUG.COM to the new disk.

    4.	Use the COPY command to copy the files STKPAT.BAT, STKPAT.SCR,
	RMRHS.EXE, and SETRHS.EXE from the \PATCH directory of your hard-disk
	drive to the new disk.

    5.	Reboot your system from the floppy disk that you prepared in steps 1-4.

    6.	Run the STKPAT.BAT file to patch the IBMBIO.COM file on the new disk.

    7.	Use the SYS command to transfer the patch from the floppy disk to any
	other Version 3.20 disk. For example, if you normally boot from drive
	C:, you would enter these commands to transfer the patched DOS to
	your hard-disk drive:

	    A:
	    SYS C:

	This installs the patch.

    8.	Reboot your system as you normally do.
