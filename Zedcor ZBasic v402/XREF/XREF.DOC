Well, you've been screaming for a cross-reference utility for your ZBasic
programs, so here it is!  XREF was originally written by Jeff Moore on the
Apple //e in ZBasic, and then ported to the IBM and modified slightly (to
take advantage of the IBM's special features) by Greg Branche.  This .DOC
file contains a little bit of information on how to use the darn thing!

The first thing you need to do is save the program that you want cross-
referenced in ASCII format, using the SAVE* command from within ZBasic.  XREF
will only work with ASCII format source files. Once you've got the ASCII file
on disk, execute XREF (either from within ZBasic, or as a .COM file after
you've created one).  The first thing you'll see is a prompt asking you for
the file name of the source file to cross- reference.  This file MUST be in
the currently logged directory (if you want the program to support pathnames,
modify XREF!).  After entering the filename, the program will ask you which
items you'd like a cross- reference listing on.


Line label definitions
     This option will list every label defined in the program, and the line
number associated with that label.

String constants
     This option will list every string constant used in the program, as well
as every line label reference.  For example, the line

     00010 GOSUB "INIT"

will be parsed by XREF and an entry will appear in the string constants
listing.

Numeric constants
     This option will list every numeric constant used in the program. Again,
this includes line # references in GOSUB, GOTO, etc. statements.

Variables
     This option will list the variables used in the program, and the line #
of each reference to the variable.

Keywords
     This option will produce a listing of ZBasic keywords and the program
line that each keyword is used in.

Display parsing actions
     Turning this option ON will have XREF display each line as it is read
in, and then each item within the line as the program parses the line.  If
this option is turned off, XREF will display a dot for each line processed
(so that you know that it's at least doing SOMEthing!).  At any time during
the parsing phase of operation, you can press the space bar to pause the
output.  Once paused, the space bar will single step through each line.  Any
other key will allow the program to continue.  CTRL-C will abort the
process.

Require spaces between keywords
     This option is the same as the one on the ZBasic configure page, and
should be set the same as ZBasic when the program was saved.

Printer on for X-Ref listing
     This option simply routes output of the final XREF report to the
printer.  If this option is turned off, the report is produced on the screen,
one screenful at a time.  The program will pause at the end of each screenful
of information and wait for you to press a key to continue.

The default answer for each of these options is "N".  If you just press
<RETURN> at each of the questions, the default will be accepted.  At least
ONE of the first five questions must be answered as "Y".  The program will
not continue until at least one of the report options has been selected (if
you didn't want a cross reference listing, you wouldn't have run the program
in the FIRST place).


This XREF utility is supplied in source code format so that you can modify it
to your own liking.  If you make any modifications that you feel are
worthwhile, drop us a line!  We'll put your fix in the newsletter (and our
copy of XREF) for all to enjoy.
