
ZCALC Notes

ZCalc is a spreadsheet program that uses a command structure similar to
Lotus 1-2-3.  The following notes describe the various commands.  If the
program doesn't do something that you'd like it to, feel free to modify it.
In addition, if you see something in the source code that you'd like to use
in your own programs, feel free to do so.

KEYBOARD

The following keys perform the following functions:

{HOME} : Move the cell pointer position to A1
{PGUP} : Move the cell pointer one page up
{PGDN} : Move the cell pointer one page down
{F6}   : Go to a specific cell location
{F9}   : Recalculate the contents of the spreadsheet


ENTERING NUMBERS, FORMULA AND LABELS

To enter a formula, press the '=' sign and then type the formula.  A
formula can consist of numbers, cell references, and cell names.
In addition, the four basic mathematical operators and parentheses are
allowed.  The program parses from left to right, with expressions inside
parentheses evaluated first.

Two functions are currently implemented.  They are covered later in the
notes.

To enter a number, just type the number.

To enter a label, enter the label, or if the label begins with a number,
enter a double quote first.


CELL REFERENCES

Cell references consist of letters for columns and numbers for rows.
Cells past column Z are represented by double letters: AA, AB and so on.
Cell blocks are represented by the upper left and lower right
coordinates separated by a comma.  For example:  A1,B2   B5,E10  etc.


COMMANDS

The command menu is brought up with the '/' key.

A command can be executed by moving the bar to the command and pressing
enter, or just hitting the first key of the command (upper case only).
Sub-menus work in a similar fashion.


FILE COMMAND

The file command allows the user to load, save or delete a file.


ERASE COMMAND

The erase command erase the spreadsheet.


COPY COMMAND

The copy command allows a range of cells to be copied from one part
of the spreadsheet to another.


WIDTH COMMAND

The width command allows the width a column to be adjusted.


RANGE COMMAND

The range command allows ranges of cells to be erased or formatted
to look a different way.

The command will first ask for the range, and then whether or not the
range is to be deleted or re-formatted.


INSERT COMMAND

Insert allows the insertion of rows or columns in the spreadsheet.  Cell
references are adjusted.


DELETE COMMAND

Delete allows the deletion of rows or columns in the spreadsheet.  Cell
references are adjusted.


PRINT COMMAND

Print allows the spreadsheet to be printed.


NAME COMMAND

THe name command allows cells to be named, instead of referred to
by just their address.  For example cell F1 could be named TAX, allowing
a formula like 'TAX*A1' instead of 'F1*A1'.


MSDOS COMMAND

This command returns temporarily to the operating system.  Type EXIT
from the DOS prompt to return to the spreadsheet.


QUIT COMMAND

The quit command allows the user to exit the program.

MACROS

Macros are supported.  To create a macro, do this:

1.  Move to a cell and type a double quote followed by the keystrokes
    you would normally type for the command.

2.  Give this cell a name consisting of a backslash followed by a letter.

3.  To invoke the macro, type Ctrl and the letter.

To use arrow and other special keys in a macro, type the key name
inside brackets.  For example:  {UP}  {RECALC}  {JUMP}  {PGDN}.
