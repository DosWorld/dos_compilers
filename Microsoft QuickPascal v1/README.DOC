    Release Notes for Microsoft(R) QuickPascal

    (C) Copyright Microsoft Corporation, 1989

You can read the release notes directly from the ON-Line help.

The ON-line help file containing the release notes is titled:
QPENV.ENV.  If you are running HELP from a floppy drive make sure
that QPENV.ENV is present on that drive.

Special Setup Notes
-------------------

For your convenience SETUP has been modified and the "path
setting screens" section in the "Installing QuickPascal"
chapter of "Up and Running" has changed.  You will now only
set three "paths" instead of four.  The DOC path has been
eliminated.

Documentation Note:
-------------------

Page 17 of "Up and Running" tells you that to run QuickPascal
you should put disk 1 in drive A.  It should instead say
put "Program disk" in drive A.  In addition "SYSTEM.QPU" is
now on the "Libraries" disk instead of on DISK 1.

Special Instructions for QP Express
-----------------------------------
You may have difficulty running the QP Express Computer-Based
Training (CBT) program due to your video driver/graphics card
combination. Try the following:

1. Make a backup copy of the QP Express or QP Express/QP Advisor
disk. Use the backup copy for the remainder of this procedure.

2. On the backup copy of the QP Express or QP Express/QP Advisor disk
you will find files with the extension .VID. Each of these files
is a driver for a specific type of graphics card. The following
drivers support the indicated graphics cards:

     ATT6300.VID       For Olivetti and ATT PCs.
     CGASNO.VID        For CGA cards that produce a snow effect.
     ERICSSON.VID      For Ericsson PCs
     HERC102.VID       For the Hercules 102 card
     HERC112.VID       For the Hercules 112 card

If you use one of these computers/displays, rename the appropriate
driver to SCREEN.VID. For example, if you run an AT&T computer,
type: RENAME ATT6300.VID SCREEN.VID

3. You can now resume SETUP or run the CBT directly by typing: LEARN.
