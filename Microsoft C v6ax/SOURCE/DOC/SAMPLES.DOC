     Files              Description
     -----              -----------

     GRDEMO.MAK         GRDEMO illustrates general graphics techniques
     GRDEMO.C           including drawing, animation, palette
     MENU.C             switching, window adjustment, menus, and
     MENU.H             turtle graphics. The MENU and TURTLE modules
     TURTLE.C           are independent modules that could be used
     TURTLE.H           in your own programs. Real mode only.

     CHRTDEMO.MAK       CHRTDEMO illustrates presentation graphics
     CHRTDEMO.C         techniques. You can use this program as a tool
     CHRTSUPT.C         for testing different modes and options before
     CHRTDEMO.H         building them into your own programs. Real mode
                        only.

     SORTDEMO.C         Visually illustrates six different sorting
                        algorithms. The source code demonstrates how
                        to make OS/2 calls. Real or protect mode.

     SNAP.C             Runs in the background and saves the current
                        screen in a file when a hot key is pressed.
                        Protect mode only.

     INCLUDE.C          A PWB extension file that implements an include
                        command that finds and opens include files.

     TXTFMT.C           A PWB extension file that implements various
                        commands related to text formatting. You can use
                        these commands to format paragraphs, center
                        text, change case, and insert or delete tab
                        spaces.

     FILTER.C           A PWB extension file that implements a filter
                        command. You can use it to replace a block of
                        text with the output of a user-specified
                        filter (such as the DOS SORT program).

======================< Note on Graphics Libraries >=======================

GRDEMO and CHRTDEMO require GRAPHICS.LIB. CHRTDEMO also requires
PGCHART.LIB. SORTDEMO requires GRAPHICS.LIB for DOS or GRTEXTP.LIB for
OS/2. If you did not request these libraries in your combined library
files during setup, you will get "unresolved external" linker errors
when you try to compile the programs.

If you are using CL, specify the library names on the command line.
For example, use this command line to compile GRDEMO:

        CL GRDEMO.C MENU.C TURTLE.C GRAPHICS.LIB

If you are using PWB, you can use the supplied program list (.MAK)
files. These automatically add the appropriate libraries.

======================< Note on Naming Conventions >=======================

The example programs use a subset of the naming conventions used in
OS/2 and Windows include files. In this convention, the first
character of an identifier is a lowercase letter called a prefix.
Common prefixes include p (pointer), a (array), i (index), and c
(count). After the prefix, there may be an additional lowercase tag,
usually indicating type. Common tags include ch (char), f (flag), sz
(zero-terminated string) l (long), and x or y (x or y coordinate).
Following this there may be one or more qualifiers, each beginning
with an uppercase letter. For example, an identifier called
achFileName is an array (a) of characters (ch) containing a file name
(FileName).
