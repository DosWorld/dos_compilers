CHAPTER  6     DATA DIVISION

         6.2   Record Description Entry

         6.2.5 Numeric Items
             
               3. Binary Item

      Warning: Regardless of the number of digits
               specified in the PICTURE clause for
               a COMP-0 or COMP-4 item, truncation
               and the SIZE ERROR condition occur 
               only when a value moved to such an
               item exceeds the range (described
               above) for a 2-byte (COMP-0) or 4-
               byte (COMP-4) SIGNED binary integer.
               A COMP-0 item has an implicit PICTURE
               S9(5), and a COMP-4 item has an 
               implicit PICTURE S9(10).
 
               Binary items are always considered
               to be signed, even if the PICTURE 
               omits the sign character S.



CHAPTER 7      PROCEDURE DIVISION


        7.2    Arithmetic Statements

        7.2.1  SIZE ERROR Option

      Warning: For binary items, defined with 
               USAGE COMP-0 or COMP-4, truncation
               and the SIZE ERROR condition occur 
               only when a value moved to such an 
               item exceeds the range for a 2-byte
               (COMP-0) or 4-byte (COMP-4) SIGNED 
               binary integer. A COMP-0 item has 
               an implicit PICTURE S9(5), and a 
               COMP-4 item has an implicit PICTURE
               S9(10), regardless of the number of
               digits specified in the PICTURE
               clause.


         7.6   PROCEDURE DIVISION Statements

         7.6.1 ACCEPT Statement

               The Format 1 ACCEPT obtains date or time 
	       information from the operating system. It
	       places the amount of data specified into
	       identifier, regardless of the size of
	       identifier. (For example, DATE will move
	       6 digits of information even if identifier
	       is PIC XX). Be sure identifier is large enough
	       to hold the output of ACCEPT.

         7.6.1.1 Format 1 ACCEPT Statement
	       
	       LINE NUMBER

	       a two-digit value. The ACCEPT ... FROM LINE 
	       NUMBER is provided for compatibility with
	       other COBOL's, but in Microsoft COBOL the 
	       value of LINE NUMBER is always "00".
