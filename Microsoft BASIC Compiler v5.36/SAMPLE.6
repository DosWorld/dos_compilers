The manual which is on the disk consist of excerpts from
the  actual  714  page manual which is shipped with each
BetterBASIC package.  The file  called  READ.ME  is  the
manual  file.   This  "demo" manual is approximately 100
pages long and details all  of  the  major  features  of
BetterBASIC  so  that  you  can  use  the sample disk to
evaluate BetterBASIC.

There  are  two  ways  to  print  the manual out on your
printer.  The easiest way and the only way to do  it  on
DOS  1.1  is  to  use the DOS command TYPE.  To use this
command to print the manual proceed as follows:

!      1.   Press the Ctrl and the PrtSc keys 
!      2.   Next issue the command  TYPE READ.ME
!      3.   Then press the Enter key.

If  your printer is on line then the manual should start
printing on the printer and  be  visible  on  the  video
display.   After  the  manual  is  finished printing you
should press the Ctrl and PrtSc keys  to  turn  off  the
printer.

!     2.   Press the Enter key

The  commands  which  are  not listed in this manual are
similar to the commands in the PC BASIC manual  and  are
not  listed  to save space on the disk.  All BetterBASIC
commands  are,  of  course,  fully  documented  in   the
714-page manual shipped with BetterBASIC.
