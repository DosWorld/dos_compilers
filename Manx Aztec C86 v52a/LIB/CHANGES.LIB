------------ Released beta 1 ------------------------
6/7/92 jd: dos/utime.c
	changed utime() to call _dosdattim() instead of time()
	i.e. use dos format for a file's time instead of secs since jan 1, 1970

6/24/92 jd: dos/ioctl.c
	ioctl() was aborting when called with a valid fd

6/29/92 jd: dos/makefile
	large code model not supported for overlays, so removed lc files
	from makefile

8/28/92 jd: stdio/getc.c & filbuf.c
	When reading ctrl-z from a text stream, getc was not returning EOF.

8/31/92 jd:
	Removed lmalloc.c from stdlib.lzh (obsolete)
	Removed pow.asm from math.lzh (pow.c contains actual source)
	Removed ttyio.asm from sysio.lzh (ttyio.c contains actual source)
	Removed croot.asm from 86sup.lzh (croot.c contains actual source)
	Removed fclose.asm from stdio.lzh (fclose.c contains actual source)

8/31/92 jd: stdio/fwrite.c
	When outputting in text mode, fwrite() translated \n to \n\r, not
	\r\n.

9/1/92 jd: dos/ioctl.c
	changed ioctl to use stdin, stdout, or stderr, whichever is assigned
	to console.

9/1/92 jd: graphics/mode.c & point.asm
	added support for ega & vga graphics modes

9/8/92 jd: 86sup/crt0.asm
	changed reference from v4.10a to v5.2a

9/8/92 jd: open.c, sysio/io.asm, include/fcntl.h, & sysio/ioincl.c
	Added code to check that file handle doesn't go beyond end of our _ioflg[]
	array. 
	Created ioincl.c, which, when precompiled into ioincl.h, defines
	array size in assembler terms.

9/20/92 jd: 86sup/filetime.c
	replaced LocalFileTime() in 86sup/locftime.c with TimeFile2TM() in 
	filetime.c

	Added new function TimeTM2File() in 86sup/filetime.c.

9/21/92 jd: dos/scdir.c
	Added new feature to scdir(): when called with NULL parameter, it resets
	and can then be called with new pattern.

9/23/92 jd: string/movblock.asm
	Changed movblock() so that length of 0 means "don't move anything", instead
	of "move 64kb".

	Fixed bug where movblock could occasionally move 1 byte too many.

9/23/92 jd: rom86/abeginsd.asm & rom86/abeginld.asm
	Fixed code for initializing far data

	Fixed bug where these routines were setting starting address of 
	near initialized data in ROM 1 byte too high. (i.e. should be _Cend_, not
	_Cend_+1).
