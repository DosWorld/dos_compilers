CPM.EXE allows execution of CP/M-86 .CMD files under MS-DOS and PC-DOS.

A>CPM <cpm-86 file name> <paramaters>

To run CP/M-80 .COM files, run the Z80 emulator under the CPM emulator:

A>CPM Z80 <cpm-80 file name> <paramaters>

Don't try running any funny CP/M stuff that calls the BIOS disk I/O
functions directly.  It won't work.  Other than that, virtually any
CP/M-86 .CMD program will be successfully executed.  Note that programs
which make use of MP/M or Concurrent extended functions will not work.

All functions except one are totally machine independent, and should
run on any hardware configuration of MS-DOS version 3.0 or greater.
The only exception:  There is no DOS function call for printer status,
and the CP/M printer status request is translated to INT 17H.  This
should work fine on any PC or PC Clone.


Nov 30/97:

ANSI.SYS is required if you plan to run .CMD files that use IBM CP/M-86
version 1.1 or newer (or CCPM, CDOS etc) escape sequences.  The following
CP/M escape sequences are converted to ANSI escape sequences:

ESC A           cursor up
ESC B           cursor down
ESC C           cursor forward
ESC D           cursor back
ESC E           clear screen and cursor home
ESC H           cursor home
ESC K           clear to end of line from cursor position
ESC Y           set cursor position
ESC :           program function key
ESC a           set video mode
ESC b           set forground color
ESC c           set background color
ESC j           save cursor position
ESC k           restore cursor position
ESC m           cursor on
ESC n           cursor off
ESC p           reverse video on
ESC q           reverse video off
ESC r           intensity on
ESC s           blink on
ESC t           blink off
ESC u           intensity off


WordStar key translations are preformed based on an IBM compatible keyboard
as follows:

ALT-X           ^KX     Save and exit
Up Arrow        ^E      Cursor up
Down Arrow      ^X      Cursor down
Left Arrow      ^S      Cursor left
Right Arrow     ^D      Cursor right
Page Up         ^R      Scroll screen up
Page Down       ^C      Scroll screen down
Insert          ^V      Toggle insert mode
Delete          ^G      Delete character at cursor
Home            ^QS     Beginning of line
End             ^QD     End of line
Ctrl-Page Down  ^QC     End of document
Ctrl-Page Up    ^QR     Beginning of document

Configuration options:

You will need a hex editor to change configuration.  Search for the
string "USER OPTIONS" in CPM.EXE.  Currently, the following options
can be changed:

BDOS call frequencies.

Offset 655 hex.  0 = no frequencies, 1 = tabulate CP/M BDOS call
frequencies.  Default = off.  If this option is set, after any CP/M-86
CMD file terminates, run CPMFREQ.EXE and examine CPMFREQ.TXT.
CPMFREQ.EXE requires CPM.TXT and CPMFREQ.DAT.  CPMFREQ.DAT is produced
by the CP/M emulator.

WordStar key translation.

Offset 685 hex.  0 = no translation, 1 = translate to WS key sequences.
Default = on.

IBM-PC CP/M-86 screen escape sequences.

Offset 6B5 hex.  0 = no translation, 1 = translate CP/M-86 screen codes
to ANSI.  Default = on.  ANSI.SYS required if enabled.

BDOS version.

Offset 6E5 hex.  This is a BCD value for the BDOS version that CP/M
function 12 returns.  Default value = 31 hex.  Change to 22 hex for
CP/M-86.

CP/M compatibility.

Offset 715 hex.  0 = CP/M compatible, 1 = CCP/M, CDOS compatible.
Default = 0 (CP/M compatible).  This changes how BDOS functions 31
(get_DBP) and 53 (mc_max) operate:

CP/M compatible:        Function 31 (get DBP) returns SPT (sectors per
                        track) as the number of logical 128 byte sectors.
                        Function 53 (get max memory) does not allocate
                        the memory.

CCP/M compatible:       Function 31 (get DBP) returns SPT as the number
                        of physical sectors.
                        Function 53 (get max memory) allocates the memory.

Revision history:

12/10/85       Initial version

10/06/96 1.1   Added option to record frequency of CP/M BDOS calls.

11/03/97 1.2   Implemented segment relocation fixups.  Now DRC.CMD works.

11/30/97 1.3   Implemented Wordstar key translation for IBM keyboard.
               Implemented CP/M-86 for IBM-PC screen escape sequences.
               Translates to ANSI.  ANSI.SYS required.
