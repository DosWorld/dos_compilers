Increasing File Handles for the FORTRAN 5.10 Run-Time Libraries
---------------------------------------------------------------

There are two methods available for increasing the number of file handles
available to a program.  One method is to modify and assemble the files
CRT0DAT.ASM and UNIT.ASM as described in the header of the file UNIT.ASM.
The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) is required to assemble these two files. 
Use the following commands to assemble the files with MASM 5.0 or 5.1:

MASM /Mx UNIT.ASM

MASM /Mx /Dmem_L CRT0DAT.ASM
or,
MASM /Mx /Dmem_M CRT0DAT.ASM

where L and M are for Large and Medium model run-time libraries. If you
are using MASM 6.00, rename the file CMACROS.NEW to replace the file
CMACROS.INC.  Use the following commands to assemble the files:

MASM /Mx UNIT.ASM

MASM /Mx /Dmem_L /DMS_STARTUP CRT0DAT.ASM
or,
MASM /Mx /Dmem_M /DMS_STARTUP CRT0DAT.ASM


The other method is to use the pre-compiled modules provided in this
directory tree. The files CRT0DAT.ASM and UNIT.ASM have been compiled
with 64 handles as opposed to the normal 20 handles.
The modules provided are:

UNIT.OBJ                - used with all models/operating systems

OS2\CRT0DATL.OBJ        - large model, OS/2 EXE
OS2\CRT0DATM.OBJ        - medium model, OS/2 EXE
DOS\CRT0DATL.OBJ        - large model, DOS EXE
DOS\CRT0DATM.OBJ        - medium model, DOS EXE
WINDOWS\CRT0DATL.OBJ    - large model, Windows EXE
WINDOWS\CRT0DATD.OBJ    - large model, Windows DLL

To use these object files, place them on the .OBJ line of the linker
and specify the /NOE switch when linking.  You may also use the LIB
utility to replace the existing modules in your run-time libraries
with the objects above.  For example:

  LIB LLIBFOR7.LIB -+ UNIT.OBJ - CRT0DAT.OBJ + CRT0DATL.OBJ;

would replace the appropriate modules in LLIBFOR7.LIB.
