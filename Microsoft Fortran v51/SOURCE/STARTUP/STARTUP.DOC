FORTRAN Run-time Library Startup Sources
---------------------------------
The directory \STARTUP and its subdirectories contain the files
necessary for building the startup portion of the FORTRAN run-time library.
The \STARTUP directory contains the startup source files, the include files, 
the batch file, and the make file used to build the startup object files.  
The subdirectories of \STARTUP contain operating-system (OS) specific sources.

The startup object files can be built by invoking STARTUP.BAT from within
the \STARTUP directory.  This batch file assumes the following:

	(1) MMAKE.EXE, LINK.EXE, the FORTRAN compiler, and the assembler must
	be in the execution path.  Microsoft(R) Macro Assembler Version 5.0 
	or later is required to build the startup sources.
	(2) OS2.LIB must be in the directory specified by the LIB
	environment variable.

Startup will create two memory-model specific subdirectories (M and L)
and place the appropriate object files there. Under each memory model 
subdirectory, startup creates two additional subdirectories, OS2 and DOS, 
where OS-specific objects reside.

The message "<cEnd - nogen>" is generated when some of the assembly language 
source files are assembled.  This message is expected and is benign.

The startup batch file requires as arguments a list of capital letters
describing the memory models you wish to build.  For example,
"startup M L" will build the medium- and large-model startup objects.
STARTUP.BAT will then link the objects with a sample FORTRAN program called 
NULBODY.FOR to produce NULBODY.EXE. Invoking STARTUP.BAT with no arguments 
will give usage information.

If you are assembling the source files with MASM 6.0, then replace 
CMACROS.INC with CMACROS.NEW and add "-DMS_STARTUP" to the ASMFLAGS
line in MAKEFILE.

Note:  Startup sources written in assembly language have been edited with
tabstops set to 8.
