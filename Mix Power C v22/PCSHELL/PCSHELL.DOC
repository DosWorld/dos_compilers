        DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE
        
        Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
        before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue
        using it, you are expected to register. Individual programs
        differ on details -- some request registration while others
        require it, some specify a maximum trial period. With
        registration, you get anything from the simple right to continue
        using the software to an updated program with printed manual.
        
        Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software,
        and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
        exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors are accomplished
        programmers, just like commercial authors, and the programs are
        of comparable quality. (In both cases, there are good programs
        and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of
        distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy
        and distribute the software, either to all and sundry or to a
        specific group. For example, some authors require written
        permission before a commercial disk vendor may copy their
        Shareware.
        
        Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You
        should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook,
        whether it's commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system makes
        fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you buy.
        And because the overhead is low, prices are low also. Shareware
        has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
        product, you don't pay for it.
        
        DISTRIBUTION LIMITATIONS:  This is a copyrighted shareware
        program.  You have a limited license to try out this soft-
        ware on a single computer for a period of 30 days.  If you
        continue to use the software after this 30-day trial period,
        you must become a registered user.
        
        OMBUDSMAN
        
          This program is produced by a member of the Association of
        Shareware Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that
        the shareware principle works for you.  If you are unable to
        resolve a shareware-related problem with an ASP member by
        contacting the member directly, ASP may be able to help.  The
        ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem with
        an ASP member, but does not provide technical support for 
        members' products.  Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at 545
        Grover Road, Muskegon, MI 49442 or send a CompuServe message
        via CompuServe Mail to ASP Ombudsman, 70007,3536.
        
        DISCLAIMER
        
           The program described in this documentation is guaranteed

        Now that the semi-legal mumbo-jumbo is out of the way, welcome
        to POWER C SHELL Version 2.12.  This program began as a simple 
        aid to Power C programmers and blossomed into a much more am-
        bitious project.  POWER C SHELL Version 2.12 has the following 
        features:

             - Simplifies editing, compiling, and debugging
             of POWER C programs without having to fool with
             the DOS command line
        	
             - Customizable editor and viewer (use your favorites),
             or use the very handy TDE public domain editor in-
             cluded in the package
        	
             - Customizable compile & link options for Power C 
             compiler (with help screens to explain them all)

        STARTING POWER C SHELL VERSION 2.12
        
           Power C Shell itself requires approximately 135K of free
        memory to run.  To this amount, however, you must add the 
        greater of the memory required by your editor, viewer, and 
        whatever C program you happen to be working on.  Power C Shell
        remains in memory when these programs are executing.  The
        Power C compiler, version 2.x, requires about 256K of free
        memory.  Basically, a 512K machine or better is a safe bet, al-
        though you might get by with only 384K available.  If you wish
        to use Power C Trace with Power C Shell, you will need much more
        available memory: 150k for Power C Trace, 135k for Power C
        Shell, and whatever memory is required the program which you are
        working on.
        
        
        
        	Environment Variables
        	=====================
        	
           Power C Shell can configure itself through the use of
        environment variables. Power C Shell understands the following
        environment variables:
        
             PCEDIT:     complete path of your editor
             PCEDITP:    any command line parameters used by your editor
             PCVIEW:     complete path of your viewer
             PCVIEWP:    any command line parameters used by your viewer
             PCOPTIONS:  default compile options to be used by PC.EXE
             PCLINK:     default link options to be used by PCL.EXE
        	
           Environment variables are established by use of the DOS
        SET command.  To set the name of your viewer to C:\LIST.COM,
        simply type the following at the DOS command line:
        
             SET PCVIEW=C:\LIST.COM
        	
           Use a similar procedure to set the other variables.  To
        set your default compile options to "/e/ms" (link file, use
        small memory model), type the following on the DOS command 
        line:
        
             SET PCOPTIONS=/e/ms
        	
           If, while entering your environment variables, you get
        the message "Out of environment space" or something similar,
        you need to edit your CONFIG.SYS file.  Look for a state-
        ment similar to the following:
        
             SHELL=c:\dos\command.com c:\dos /p
        	
           To increase the environment space, change the statement
        to something like this:
        

                                     Page 6





             SHELL=c:\dos\command.com c:\dos /p /e:384
        	
           In the example above, 384 is the new number of bytes re-
        served for the environment (160 is the default).  DOS will 
        always round this number to a multiple of 16.  384 bytes 
        should be enough for most users, although you may need more.
        The limit is 32,768, although there should never be a need 
        for more than 1 or 2K.   See your DOS manual for more de-
        tails on setting the environment size.  Note that you must 
        reboot your computer after editing your CONFIG.SYS file for
        any changes to take effect.
        
           The PCEDITP and PCVIEWP parameter variables assume that
        your editor and viewer accept command line switches AFTER the 
        filename to edit/view.  For example:
        
             <PCEDIT> (filename) <PCEDITP>
             edit   program.c   -x -e
        	  
           If your editor/viewer only accept parameters and switches
        BEFORE the filename, enter them as part of the PCEDIT or 
        PCVIEW varaibles.  For example:
        
             <PCEDIT>     (filename)
             edit -x -e   program.c
        	
           you would enter the following command on the DOS command 
        line prior to starting Power C Shell:
        
             SET PCEDIT=edit -x -e
        
           Environment variables will override any options contained
        in the PCSHELL.CFG configuration file.
        
        	
             Running Power C Shell
             =====================
        	
             The syntax for starting Power C Shell is as follows:
        	
               PCS2 [filename] [/D-] [/H]
        	   
               [filename] optional parameter specifying complete
                          name of source file to work on
               
               [/D-]      optional parameter telling PCS to ignore its
                          configured starting directory and use the
                          current directory
               
               [/H]       display a brief help screen
             
        
        
             

                                     Page 7





             Configuring PCS
             =========== ===
             
           Prior to using PCS, you will have to configure it.  You may
        do this either through the environment variables described above
        or through the Configuration pull-down menu detailed below.  At
        a minimum, you will need to specify the name of your editor and
        any compile options you would like used with the Power C.
        
               
             Installing PCS
             ========== ===
           
           It is recommended, but not necessary, to copy the PCS2.EXE
        program file to the same directory containing your Power C com-
        piler.  If you would like to be able to use PCS from any direc-
        tory, make sure the PCS2.EXE file is placed in a subdirectory
        contained in your DOS PATH.
        
           If you would like to use the TDE editor with PCS, place the
        TDE program files in a directory accessible to PCS.  If this
        directory is not also on your DOS PATH, you will have to specify
        the COMPLETE path for TDE when you configure PCS.

        POWER C SHELL DISPLAY
        
             Project Board
             
           The main display is divided up into three areas.  The largest
        area, in the upper left portion of the screen, is the "project
        board" which lists information regarding the current project
        being worked on.
        
           Space here is used to list all currently open source files
        (up to seven), the name of the project make file, the name of
        the executable file being linked to, the current working dir-
        ectory, the name of any object library specified, and the name
        of the project include file.
        
             
             Memory Management Display
             
           To the right of the "project board" is the memory management
        display, showing current allocations of stack, heap, and far
        heap memory.
        
        
             Status Board
           
           In the bottom area of the screen is the "status board."  This
        area is used to display current Power C Shell settings such as
        the name of the editor and viewer and their switches, and any
        command line switches in effect for the Power C compiler, link-

        POWER C SHELL MENU OPTIONS
        
             Files Menu
             ===== ====
        
           Pressing the Alt-F key combination will activate the Files
        pull-down menu, which contains the following options:        	
        
        
             Open 
             
           Selecting this menu choice will allow you to open a file for
        editing and/or compiling.  Up to seven files, all belonging to
        the same project, may be open at one time in PCS v2.12.  After
        selecting this item, you'll be asked to enter a wildcard file
        specification.  The default is *.C; however, you may enter any
        value you like.  A list of all files matching the entered wild-
        card pattern will be displayed in a box centered on the screen.
        Using the cursor keys, position the highlight bar over the name
        of the file you would like to open and then press <Enter>.
        
           If you open a Power C project file with a .PRJ extension, all
        of the associated source files of the project will be opened.
        NOTE:  This project file MUST be in PCS 2.12 format for this to
        work properly.  If you open a project file while other files are
        open, they will be closed first and then the project will be
        loaded.
        
           If more than one file is open, you will be asked to choose an
        "active file."  The active file is the file which is loaded by
        the "Edit" menu choice described below.  Enter the file number
        (1-7) of the file which you would like to be active.  A pair
        of flashing exclamation points appears next to the name of the 
        active file.
        
        
             New file
             
           Selecting this menu item will allow you to type the name of a
        new C source file on upon which to begin work.  Do NOT enter the
        name of a project (*.PRJ) file.  Again, if multiple files are
        open, you will be asked to select the active file.
        
        
             Switch
           
           Selecting this item will allow you to change the active file.
        	
        
             Edit
        	
           Selecting this menu item will invoke your editor and load the
        currently active file for editing.

             Close
           
           This option allows you to remove a file from the list of
        open source files.  Type the number of the file you wish to
        close in the dialog box.  If more than one file remains open,
        you will be asked to designate a new active file.
        
        
             All Close
           
           This option will remove ALL files from the open list.
           
           
             Print
           
           This option allows you to print one or more files associated
        with the current project.  In the dialog box that appears, press
        "A" to print all source files, "I" to print the project #include
        file (*.H), or the number of a single open file.  Next, you'll
        be asked to specify which printer port (LPT1-3) to print to.
        
           If there is an error, PCS will inform you of the nature of the
        problem and provide you with the opportunity of correcting it or
        aborting the print operation.
        
        
             Directory
           
           This option allows you to change the current working direc-
        tory.  Enter a drive letter, directory, or complete path, as
        appropriate, into the dialog box.  Any open files will be closed
        upon changing directories.
        
        
             Operations Menu
             ========== ====
             
           Pressing the Alt-O key combination activates the Operations
        pull-down menu, which contains the following options:
        
        
             Compile
           
           Selecting this item invokes the Power C compile and compiles
        the currently open source file(s).  Any compile options speci-
        fied through the PCS configuration file or environment variables
        will eb in effect for the compilation.
        
           The compile listing will appear on the screen and you will
        have the opportunity to view it prior to return to PCS.  To pre-
        vent the listing from scrolling off the screen, include the
        #pragma pagesize preprocessor directive in your program source.

             Link
           
           The current project or source file will be linked, using the
        options specified through the configuration file or environment
        variable.  The executable file produced will have the same name
        as the first open file, with the extension .EXE.
        
        
             Header
             
           Selecting this option will invoke your editor and load the
        project #include (*.H) file.  Using such a file is an easy way
        to declare external variables by using the #include file in
        supplementary project source code modules.
        
        
             View C.ERR
             
           This option will invoke your viewer and allow you to see the
        contents of the most recent compile listing (contained in the
        C.ERR file generated by PC.EXE).
        
        
             Trace
           
           Selecting this menu item will invoke Power C Trace, a program
        available separately from Mix Software.  The PCT.EXE program
        must be located in a directory on the DOS PATH, or in the cur-
        rent directory.  You should also have compiled your program with
        the /T switch, and subsequently linked it, prior to running the
        trace program.
        
        
             DOS Shell
           
           This option allows you to return momentarily to the DOS com-
        mand line without exiting PCS 2.12.  A reminder will appear in
        your prompt informing you to type "exit" to return to PCS.  
        While you are in the DOS Shell, keep in mind that your total
        free memory is reduced by approximately 135k.
        
        
             Configuration Menu
             ============= ====
             
           Pressing the Alt-C key combination will activate the Con-
        figuration pull-down menu, which includes the following op-
        tions:
        
        
             Editor
           

                                     Page 12





           Selecting this option will allow you to enter the name of
        your editor.  In the first dialog box, enter the complete path
        and file name of your editor program.  In the second dialog box,
        enter any command line parameters (switches) required by your
        editor, if any.  The editor name and switches will then appear
        on the appropriate line in the status area at the bottom of the
        screen.
        
        
             Viewer
           
           This option allows you to configure your viewer program.
        Follow the steps above for the editor, this time typing the
        path and switches for the viewer.
        
        
             Compile Options
             
           This option will allow you to select which switches are to be
        used by the Power C compiler.  The PC.EXE file's help screen 
        will be displayed and a small dialog box will appear at the bot-
        tom of the screen.  Enter your choice into the box.
        
        
             Link Options
           
           This menu choice will allow you to specify link options.  A
        small help screen explaining the available switches will be
        presented.  Enter your switch(es) in the dialog box.
        
        
             Memory Allocations
             
           With this option you can control the size of the stack, heap,
        and far heap of your program.  Enter values for each of these
        items in the dialog box just as you would enter them on the com-
        mand line.  For example, if you want 16k of memory for the stack
        enter "16k"; if you want 800 bytes allocated for the heap, enter
        "800."
        
        
             Object Library
           
           Select this option to enter the name of an object file to be
        linked as a library.  This can be a library of your own creation
        or a third-party library.  Make use of the "?" wildcard to spec-
        ify different library names for the three memory models.  For
        example, PCS is linked with the library CJSLIBM.MIX, a library
        of functions developed by Tay-Jee Software.  By entering the
        name "CJSLIB?.MIX" as an object library, the files CJSLIBS.MIX,
        CJSLIBM.MIX, or CJSLIBL.MIX will be linked depending upon which
        memory model is in effect.  (See the Power C README file for a
        further discussion of libraries and wildcards.)
        

                                     Page 13





        
             Trace Options
           
           This option allows you to specify command line arguments for
        Power C Trace.  A brief desctiption of the available switches is
        shown in the dialog box; simply type the switch(es) you wish to
        have included on the command line when you use Power C Trace.
        
        
             Program Colors
           
           Selecting this option activates the program color selection
        process.  Nine screen elements can have their screen attributes
        individually configured.  Enter the number of the screen color
        you wish to modify, then position the flashing star character
        over the appropriate color combination, then press <Enter>.
        Once you are through selecting colors, enter "0" instead of a
        color number.  In the dialog box which appears, type N to put
        your newly selected colors into effect, O to ignore the new
        colors and use the colors in currently in effect, or D to
        revert to the program's default color scheme.  In the unreg-
        istered version, while you can change the colors selected, you
        cannot save these changes in the configuration file.
        
        
             Quit
             ====
        	
           Select this option to leave Power C Shell and return to 
        DOS.  Three options are available:  "Yes" exits PCS immediately;
        "Save" updates the PCSHELL.CFG file with the current settings,
        then returns to DOS; and "No" returns you to PCS.

        HELP
        
           Context-sensitive help is available from within the PCS
        menu system (only).  From the main PCS screen, or from within
        any pull-down menu, pressing <F1> activates the help system.
        A box will appear on the middle of the screen containing the
        help information for the currently selected menu operation.
        Use the cursor movement keys to scroll the help text up and
        down through the box.  Pressing <Esc> returns you to PCS.
        
           A passive help system also exists for all menu items.  Look
        at the bottom line on the screen for a brief description of the
        currently highlighted menu item.
        
           A short help line appears for most dialog boxes in PCS.  Most 
        "basic" editing functions, such as Insert/Delete and Backspace 
        work normally in dialog boxes.  In addition, the <Tab> key can 
        be used to DELETE all information in a dialog box which lies to 
        the right of the cursor.
        
        
           This document formatted with MARGARINE 3.1, a utility program
        I created using Power C 2.2.0 and Power C Shell.  Look for it
        in IBM Systems/Utilities Forum (IBMSYS) on CompuServe (found
        in the New Uploads or General Utilities Library as MARGAR.ZIP).
