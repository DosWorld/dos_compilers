         INTRODUCTION

         Text Editor (TE) 2.5 is a public domain, full screen ASCII text
         editor for the IBM PC and close compatibles which uses commands
         similar to those used in WordStar and Sidekick.  Features include:

           o  Display primary commands on pop-up help screen.  Prompt
              for subcommands.
           o  Insert, delete, split, join a line.
           o  Copy, delete, move, read, write, shift, hide, display
              a marked block of partial or whole lines.
           o  Print a file/block to LPT1-LPT3.
           o  Enter any ASCII code.
           o  Find/replace a phrase.
           o  Temporary return to DOS.
           o  Set left/right margins and page length.
           o  Word wrap.
           o  Format (justify) a paragraph.
           o  Program size of 29,904 bytes.

         Primary uses for TE are to create/edit batch files, generate
         forms, edit files captured by telecommunications programs, write
         E-mail and simulate a "smart" typewriter.

         The file to be edited must be able to fit into available CPU
         memory.  The ASCII file must consist of lines of characters that
         end with the CR character (ASCII 13).  If the line contains more
         than 255 characters or doesn't end with a CR, the first 255
         characters are retrieved and another line is started.  EOF
         characters (ASCII 26) found before the true end of the file are
         ignored.

         INSTALLATION

         TE consists of one file TE.EXE with a size of 29,904 bytes.  To
         load TE from any drive/directory, place TE.EXE in a directory that
         is listed in the DOS PATH statement.  TE.EXE display colors,
         laptop display colors, cursor size, default margins, and default
         page length can be changed with utility program TEMOD.EXE.

         COMMAND SUMMARY

         The symbols c-, s-, a- mean press the Ctrl, Shift or Alt key
         simultaneously with the next key.  Letters may be entered as upper
         or lower case.

         STATUS LINE

         The top screen line provides status information for the file being
         edited.

           o  F1-Help.  Where to find a pop-up screen of all TE commands.
           o  Line and column position of the cursor.
           o  Insert/Ovrwrite.  If Insert mode, an entered character will
              be added at the cursor by moving the character at the
              cursor to the right.  If Ovrwrite mode, an entered character
              will replace the character at the cursor.  Press the Ins key
              to toggle between Insert and Ovrwrite.
           o  The drive, directory, and name of the file currently being
              edited.
           o  An asterisk "*" if character(s)/line(s) have been added or
              deleted.

         The status line and the next line are temporarily used for
         additional prompts required by some commands.

         STARTING TE

         TE is started by entering TE on the DOS command line.  After TE is
         loaded, TE asks "File to edit:".  If only the Enter key is
         pressed, TE will terminate and return to DOS.  The drive/directory
         must be included if the file is not located in the current
         directory.  The file name can be edited with the Home, End,
         Left/Right arrow, Del and Bksp keys as it is entered.  If the file
         can't be found, TE asks "(file name) not found.  New file (Y/N)?".
         Enter Y or N (upper or lower case).  Pressing Enter after Y or N
         is not required.  If Y, data may be entered into the new file.  If
         N, TE asks "Enter another file name (Y/N)?".  If Y, enter the file
         name.  If N, TE will terminate.

         TE can also be started by entering TE and including the file name
         with optional drive/directory on the command line.  For example:
         TE C:\DOC\234.DOC will load the TE program and file 234.DOC from
         drive/directory C:\DOC.

         FILE/QUIT COMMANDS

         Two primary file load, file save/no save , quit commands are
         available.  Each command provides prompts for various options.

         c-KD or c-KQ or F4   Save File And Quit Editor
         ----------------------------------------------
         c-KD means press the Ctrl and K (upper or lowercase) keys
         together.  Then press D (upper or lowercase).  If no changes have
         been made to the file, TE asks "File has NOT been modified.  Quit
         editor (Y/N)?".  If Y, TE will terminate and return to DOS.  If N,
         TE can continue to be used with the current file.


                                       - 4 -

                           TEXT EDITOR 2.5 USER'S GUIDE

         If changes have been made to the file, TE asks "Save file as:
         (file name) (Y/N)?".  If N, TE asks "Quit editor (Y/N)?".  If Y,
         TE will terminate.  If N, TE can continue to be used with the
         current file.  To save changes made to the file, TE asks "Save
         file with current file name (Y/N)?".  If Y, the file will be saved
         with the current name and TE will terminate.  If N, the current
         drive/directory and file name may be changed with the Home, End,
         Left/Right arrow, Del and Bksp keys.  Press Enter to have TE save
         the new file name and terminate.

         Trailing spaces are stripped from the end of each line before the
         file is saved.  If the message "Drive not ready or can't save
         file.  Quit (Y/N)?" appears, it could mean the file is read-only.
         It is not possible to save changes to a read only file until the
         read-only attribute is removed by temporarily returning to DOS (F3
         or c-KS command) and removing the read-only attribute with the DOS
         ATTRIB command.

         If a non-ASCII file (.COM, .EXE, .WK1, etc. ) or an ASCII file
         that contains more than 255 characters per line is loaded into TE,
         DON'T SAVE THE FILE!.  TE will corrupt the saved file since TE
         loads all characters to the CR (ASCII 13) or the first 255
         characters of each line and then starts another line.  When the
         file is saved, trailing spaces (ASCII 20) are stripped and CR, LF
         (ASCII 13,10) characters are inserted.

         c-KE or F2   Save File And/Or Load Another File
         -----------------------------------------------
         The c-KE (F2) command adds to c-KD (c-KQ, F4) the question
         "Continue editing same file (Y/N)?".  If Y, the current file may
         continue to be edited.  If N, TE asks "File to edit:".  Enter a
         file name with optional drive/directory.  If TE can't find the
         file, TE asks "(file name) not found.  New file (Y/N)?".  If Y,
         enter the new file name.  If only the Enter key is pressed, TE
         will terminate and return to DOS.  If N, TE asks "Enter another
         file name (Y/N)?".  If Y, enter the file name.  If N, TE will
         terminate.

         CURSOR MOVEMENT

         Tab and s-Tab
         -------------
         Tab or s-Tab moves the cursor to a position which is equivalent to
         the next or previous word on the previous line.  Tab and s-Tab
         commands do not insert tab characters (ASCII 9) into the file.  If
         the file contains tab characters, they will be displayed as an "o"
         with the sides open.  Tabs are not converted to spaces.  Use the
         the c-QA Find/Replace command to convert a Tab character to 8
         (typically) spaces.

         c-QP   Down Page Length
         -----------------------
         The cursor is moved down page length lines.  The standard default
         value is 62 lines.  It can be changed with the c-QM Set Left/Right
         Margins and Page Length command.  This command is used to add
         headers, footers, page numbers, etc.  at specified line intervals
         in the file.

         c-Qn   To Line Mark n=0-3
         -------------------------
         Position cursor on the line previously set by c-Kn where n is
         marker 0, 1, 2, 3.  The default line marks are 20%, 40%, 60% and
         80% of the max lines in the file.  If the file contains less than
         5 lines, the default mark is line 1.

         c-Q4   To Specified Line
         ------------------------
         Position the cursor at the line number entered when TE asks
         "To line:".

         The other cursor movement commands listed in the Command Summary
         section are self explanatory.

         INSERT/DELETE COMMANDS

         Insert/delete commands always operate on the line with the cursor.

         Ins or c-V   Insert/Replace
         ---------------------------
         Toggle between character Insert and Ovrwrite (Replace) modes.
         Refer to the explanation in the Status Line section.

         Entr   Split/Insert Line
         ------------------------
         Split the line at the cursor position and move all characters over
         and to the right of the cursor to the next line.  The cursor is
         positioned to the left margin of the next line.

         c-N or F9   Insert Line
         -----------------------
         Move the line with the cursor down and insert a blank line.  The
         cursor is moved to the left margin of the new line.  If the
         current line is the last line in the file, a new blank line is
         added after the last line.

         c-Y or F10   Delete Line
         ------------------------
         Delete the line containing the cursor.  The cursor is moved to the
         left margin of the next line.

         BkSp or c-H   Delete Left Character
         -----------------------------------
         Delete the character to the left of the cursor.

                           TEXT EDITOR 2.5 USER'S GUIDE

         Del or c-G   Delete Character/Join Line
         ---------------------------------------
         Delete the character over the cursor.  If the cursor is beyond the
         end of the line, the next line is joined to the current line at
         the cursor position unless the current line is the last line in
         the file.

         c-T  Delete Next Word
         ---------------------
         Delete all characters from the cursor position to the next space
         character.  If the cursor position is at a space, all spaces will
         be deleted up to the next non-space character.  If the cursor is
         beyond the end of the line, the next line is joined to the current
         line.

         c-QY   Delete Characters To End Of Line
         ---------------------------------------
         Delete all characters from the current cursor position to the end
         of the line.  If the cursor is at the beginning of the line, the
         line is made blank and not deleted.

         Word Wrap
         ---------
         Word wrap occurs when characters entered beyond the right margin
         or column 253 cause a word (all preceding characters up to the
         next blank character) to be moved to the next line.  Word wrap is
         generated by the c-B Format Paragraph command (See Miscellaneous
         Commands section).  The left/right margins are set with the c-QM
         command.  The standard default left/right margins are columns
         1/252 (See Miscellaneous Commands section).

         BLOCK COMMANDS

         Block commands mark, copy, move, delete, read, write, print,
         indent and unindent one or more partial/whole lines.

         c-KB or F7   Mark Block Start
         -----------------------------
         Mark (high lite) the block start line and column at the current
         cursor position.  The block will be default marked to the end of
         the current line.

         c-KK or F8   Mark Block Stop
         ----------------------------
         Mark (high lite) all lines from the start block line and column,
         marked with c-KB or F7, to the line and column containing the
         current cursor position.

         c-KH   Hide/Display Block
         -------------------------
         Toggle between hide (remove high lite) or display (restore high
         lite) a marked block.  If a block is hidden, the block can't be
         copied, moved, deleted, written, or printed.

                           TEXT EDITOR 2.5 USER'S GUIDE

         c-KC   Copy Block
         -----------------
         Copy the marked block to the current cursor position.  The copied
         block is high lited.  If part or all of a single line is marked, TE
         asks "Insert (Y) or Overwrite (N)?".  If Y, the single line block
         will be added to the line by moving the characters at the cursor
         position to the right.  If N, existing characters to the right of
         the cursor will be replaced.  Multiple line blocks are always
         inserted at the cursor position.  If a copy into a marked block is
         attempted, the operation will be canceled.  If a combined line
         will contain more than 253 characters, the operation will be
         canceled.  Use c-B Format Paragraph to justify text to left/right
         margins.

         c-KV   Move Block
         -----------------
         Move the marked block to the current cursor position.  The moved
         block is high lighted.  Otherwise the operation is the same as
         Copy Block.

         c-KY   Delete Block
         -------------------
         Delete the marked block.  For multiple line blocks,  the start
         line will be deleted if the start column is at the left margin.

         c-KR   Read Block From Disk
         ---------------------------
         Read a specified file (block) from disk and insert at the line
         with the cursor.  Text on the line with the cursor is moved after
         the inserted file.  If the file is not found, the command will be
         canceled.  The command remembers the last entered block read or
         block write file name.

         c-KW   Write Block To Disk
         --------------------------
         Write a marked block to disk.  If the specified file already
         exists, it will be replaced with the contents of the marked block.
         If the disk (drive) is not ready, the command will be canceled.
         The command remembers the last entered block read or block write
         file name.

         c-KI and c-KU  Move Block Right/Left One Character
         --------------------------------------------------
         Move all lines of the marked block right (c-KI) or left (c-KU) one
         character position from the block start column.  Characters will
         be lost if they are moved right, beyond column 253 or left, beyond
         column 1.  The block end column is ignored.

         MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS

         F1   Display Summary Of TE Commands
         -----------------------------------
         The TE commands, remaining CPU memory and version number are
         listed.  Press any key to return to the file being edited.  This
         command can't be issued in the middle of another command.

         c-KP or F5    Print File Or Block To LPT1, LPT2, or LPT3
         --------------------------------------------------------
         TE asks "Print File (Y) or Block (N)?".  If Y, the complete file
         will be printed.  If N, the marked block will be printed.  Next,
         TE asks "Printer LPT1, LPT2, LPT3 or Cancel (123C)?".  Enter 1, 2,
         or 3 for printer number or C to cancel the print operation.  If
         the printer is not ready (out of paper, off line, etc), TE asks
         "Continue (Y/N)?".  Find the cause for the printer not ready, then
         answer Y.  Otherwise, answer N to cancel the print operation.

         a-Xa-Ya-Z    Enter ASCII Code 32-255 On Keypad
         ----------------------------------------------
         ASCII codes, 32-255, that are not on the keyboard (i.e. line
         drawing characters) can be entered into the file by pressing the
         Alt key while simultaneously entering the 2 or 3 digit code on the
         keypad.  The equivalent symbol will be displayed on the screen.

         c-Pa-Xa-Y    Enter ASCII Code 1-31 On KeyPad
         --------------------------------------------
         ASCII codes, 1-31, that can't be entered directly from the
         keyboard (form feed, Esc) can be entered by pressing c-P.  Then
         press the Alt key simultaneously with a 2 digit code on the
         keypad.  The equivalent symbol will be displayed on the screen.

         c-QF   Find Phrase
         ------------------
         When prompted with "Find:", enter a phrase of 1 to 31 characters.
         To prevent finding an embedded phrase, enter a space before and
         after the phrase.  For example, enter <sp>the<sp> to prevent
         finding the word "other".  Cancel the operation by pressing the
         Enter key only.  TE asks for answers to the following options.

           o  "File (Y) or Block (N)?".  If Y, the search begins at the
               current cursor column, line.  If N, the search begins at the
               start column, line of the marked block.
           o  "Case sensitive (Y/N)?".  If Y, the upper/lower case pattern
              of the letters in the phrase will be matched.  If N, case
              sensitivity will be ignored.  For example, the phrase "the"
              will find "The" and "the" if N.

         After each find, TE asks "Repeat (Y/N)?".  If Y, the search
         continues until another find or the end of the file or marked block
         is reached.  If N, the operation will be terminated.

         c-QA   Find And Replace Phrase
         ------------------------------
         The find/replace phrase command is similar to find phrase (c-QF)
         except a replace phrase of 1 to 31 characters must be entered in
         addition to "Find:" when prompted with "Replace:".  Cancel the
         operation by pressing the Enter key only.  In addition to the
         "File (Y) or Block (N)?" and "Case sensitive (Y/N)?" options, TE
         asks "Confirm replace (Y/N)?".  If N, the replace phrase will be
         substituted for the find phrase until the end of the file or block
         is reached.  If Y, the next two questions are asked each time the
         find phrase is found.

           o  TE asks "Replace (Y/N)?".  If Y, the replace phrase at the
              cursor will be substituted for the find phrase.  If N, the
              find phrase will not be replaced.
           o  TE asks "Repeat (Y/N)?".  If Y, the search will continue.
              If N, the find and replace operation will be terminated.

         c-QS or F3   Temporary Return To DOS
         ------------------------------------
         Return to DOS without removing TE from CPU memory (RAM).  Run the
         DOS command or program that will fit in remaining memory.  Type
         EXIT on the DOS command line to return to TE.  Exercise caution
         when using this command.  Other programs could corrupt RAM
         currently allocated to TE or crash the computer causing a loss of
         all data changes made to the file since it was last saved.

         c-QM   Set Right/Left Margins and Page Length
         ---------------------------------------------
         TE prompts for answers to Left Margin, Right Margin, Page Length.
         The current values are displayed.  The current values may be
         accepted by pressing Enter or the cursor keys may be used to
         edit/change the values.  The standard defaults are: Left/right
         margin - Column 1/252, Page Length - 62 lines.

         c-B   Format Paragraph
         ----------------------
         A paragraph is formated with one space between each word, two
         spaces after each period and each line left justified to fit the
         maximum number of whole words between the current left/right
         margin columns until a blank line or end of file is reached.  The
         command is ignored if the right margin is the default value 252.
         For example, the following paragraph will be processed as shown.

            Now is the            time      for  everyone            to
         come to the party. The time is      now.

                    Now is the time for everyone to come to
                    the party.  The time is now.

         The Format Paragraph command doesn't work correctly if a whole
         word is longer than the number of columns between the left and
         right margins.

         c-Kn  Set Line Mark n=0-3
         -------------------------
         Set line mark n, where n is mark 0-3, to the line that currently
         contains the cursor.  Use c-Qn to position the cursor to the
         specified mark n = 0-3.

         TE CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.2 TO 2.3

         Blocks can be marked with start/stop columns as well as start/stop
         lines.  The Block Right/Left Character commands (c-KI/c-KU) move
         all lines of the marked block one character position from the
         start block column instead of column 1.  The following function
         key assignments have been added:  F3 - Temporary return to DOS
         (c-KS), F5 - Print file or block (c-KP), F9 - Delete line (c-N).

         TE CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.3 TO 2.4

         The Mark Block Stop command now works correctly if the stop
         location is before the Mark Block Start location.  The Block Write
         command now remembers the last Block Write file name as well as
         the last Block Read file name.  The status line cursor is placed
         at the beginning of the default/last entry instead of at the end.

         TE CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.4 TO 2.5

         Added commands Delete Next Word (c-T) and To Specified Line
         (c-Q4).
