DEFINITION MODULE Storage;
(*
   Standard dynamic storage management

Storage management for dynamic variables. Calls to the
Modula-2 standard procedures NEW and DISPOSE are
translated into calls to ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE. The
standard way to provide these two procedures is to
import them from this module 'Storage'.
*)

FROM SYSTEM IMPORT ADDRESS;

EXPORT QUALIFIED
   ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, Available,
   InstallHeap, RemoveHeap;


PROCEDURE ALLOCATE (VAR a: ADDRESS; size: CARDINAL);
(*
- Allocate some dynamic storage (contiguous memory area).

in:     size    number of bytes to allocate,

out:    a       ADDRESS of allocated storage.

The actual number of bytes allocated may be slightly
greater than 'size', due to administrative overhead.

Errors: If not enough space is available, or when
attempting to allocate more than 65520 (0FFF0H)
bytes at once, then the calling program is terminated
with the status 'heapovf'.
*)


PROCEDURE DEALLOCATE (VAR a: ADDRESS; size: CARDINAL);
(*
- Release some dynamic storage (contiguous memory area).

in:     a       ADDRESS of the area to release,
        size    number of bytes to be released,

out:    a       set to NIL.

The storage area released is made available for subsequent
calls to ALLOCATE.
*)


PROCEDURE Available (size: CARDINAL) : BOOLEAN;
(*
- Test whether some number of bytes could be allocated.

in:     size    number of bytes

out:    TRUE if ALLOCATE (p, size) would succeed.

PROCEDURE InstallHeap;

- Used internally by the loader

PROCEDURE RemoveHeap;
