DEFINITION MODULE Break;
(*
   Handling of the Ctrl-Break interrupt

This module provides an interrupt handler for the
Ctrl-Break interrupt 1BH of MS-DOS and PC-DOS on the
IBM-PC. This module depends on the ROM BIOS of the
IBM-PC and will not run on any machine which is not
compatible to an IBM-PC at this level.

Module 'Break' installs a default break handler, which
stops the execution of the current program with
'System.Terminate(stopped)' when Ctrl-Break is typed.
This produces a memory dump for the stopped program.

Module 'Break' allows a program to install its own break
handler, and to enable or disable the break handler
which is currently installed.

PROCEDURE EnableBreak;
(*
- Enable the activation of the current break handler

If Ctrl-Break is detected, the currently installed break
handler will be called.
*)


PROCEDURE DisableBreak;
(*
- Disable the activation of the current break handler

If a Ctrl-Break is detected, no action takes place. The
Ctrl-Break is ignored.

PROCEDURE InstallBreak (BreakProc: PROC );
(*
- Install a break handler

in:   BreakProc   break procedure to be called upon
                  Crtl-Break

A program can install its own break handler. Module
'Break' maintains a stack of break procedures. The break
procedure on top of the stack (i.e. the one which was
installed most recently) will be called upon the
occurence of a ctrl-break. The default break handler
which is installed initially terminates the program with
a call to 'System.Terminate(stopped)'.

Up to four user defined break procedure may be installed
at the same time.
*)


PROCEDURE UnInstallBreak;
(*
- Uninstall the current break handler

Removes the break procedure which is currently on top of
the stack. So the last installed break procedure will be
deactivated, and the one installed previously becomes
active again.

END Break.
