- Apply the a procedure to all matching files

in:   wildFileName  file name, wild-characters are allowed
      DirProc       procedure to be called for each file
                    matching 'wildFileName'

out:  result        result of directory operation

'DirQuery' executes 'DirProc' on each file which satisfies
the specification of 'wildFileName' where wild-characters
are allowed. If no more files are found, or as soon as
'DirProc' returns FALSE, the execution is stopped.

If an incorrect filename is passed, this may return a
'result <> OK', and 'DirProc' will not be called.

Possible results are OK, NoFile, or OtherError.

PROCEDURE Delete(    FileName : ARRAY OF CHAR;
                 VAR result   : DirResult);

(*
- Delete a file.

in:   FileName   name of the file to delete

out:  result     result of directory operation

Possible results are OK, or NoFile.

(*
- Rename a file.

in:   FromName   name of the file to rename
      ToName     new name of the file

out:  result     result of directory operation

Possible results are OK, NoFile, ExistingFile, or
OtherError.
