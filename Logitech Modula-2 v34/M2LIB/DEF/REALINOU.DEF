DEFINITION MODULE RealInOut;
(*
   Terminal input/output of REAL values

The implementation of this module uses the procedures
'ReadString' and 'WriteString' of module 'InOut' for
reading and writing of REAL values. Therefore,
redirection of i/o through 'InOut' applies, too.

From the book 'Programming in Modula-2' by Prof.
N. Wirth.

EXPORT QUALIFIED
   ReadReal, WriteReal, WriteRealOct, Done;


VAR Done: BOOLEAN;


PROCEDURE ReadReal (VAR x: REAL);
(*
- Read a REAL from the terminal.

out:    x       the number read.

The range of representable valid real numbers is:
   1.0E-307 <= ABS(r) < 1.0E308

The syntax accepted for input is:

   realnumber       = fixedpointnumber [exponent].
   fixedpointnumber = [sign] {digit} [ '.' {digit} ].
   exponent         =  ('e' | 'E') [sign] digit {digit}.
   sign             = '+' | '-'.
   digit            = '0'|'1'|'2'|'3'|'4'|'5'|'6'|'7'|
                      '8'|'9'.

The following numbers are legal representations of one
hundred: 100, 10E1, 100E0, 1000E-1, E2, +E2, 1E2, +1E2,
+1E+2, 1E+2 .

At most 15 digits are significant, leading zeros not
counting. Input terminates a control character or space.
DEL or BS is used for backspacing

The variable 'Done' indicates whether a valid number was
read.

PROCEDURE WriteReal (x: REAL; n: CARDINAL);
(*
- Write a REAL to the terminal, right-justified.

in:     x       number to write,
        n       minimum field width.

If fewer than n characters are needed to represent x,
leading blanks are output. At least 10 characters are
needed to write any REAL number.
*)


PROCEDURE WriteRealOct (x: REAL);
(*
- Write a REAL to terminal, as four words in octal form

in:     x       number to write,
*)


END RealInOut.
