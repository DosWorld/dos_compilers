
This example shows a simple program in C that calls Modula-2 procedures.

Special attention has to be given to the following points:

- Modula-2 handles only far code and far data.  Use the 'far' keyword in
  C for all data and procedures handled also in Modula-2, or compile with
  the C compiler option /AL to use the large memory model.
  
- C doesn't provide real string variables.  Strings are handled with
  pointers to an array of characters.  Use pointers also in Modula-2
  or use the knowledge about the implementation and pass the string
  length along with the pointer.

- The bodies of the Modula-2 modules will only be executed at the beginning
  of the first call to a Modula-2 procedure.  Avoid using any module bodies.
  If you do, be aware that the initialization of the module won't occur
  before the first call.

- The program must exit by calling the function "m2exit()".  This function
  will properly exit the program by executing the Modula-2 library and
  RTS termination procedures.

  The function prototype for this function is available in the C include
  file "rtsm2exi.h".  You should "#include" this file at the beginning
  of any C modules that need to call the "m2exit()" function.
