 The Logitech Modula-2 POINT Editor 2.01
 =======================================

 The POINT Editor has had extensive improvements made to it since version
 1.52.  This file describes some of these improvements, and how to get
 started with the new version.  Information in this document replaces
 any equivalent information in the existing POINT manual.


 Version 2.01
 ------------

 The user interface for version 2.01 has been extensively enhanced to
 allow for simple and complete keyboard usage, without the use of the
 "mouse simulation" commands found in version 1.52 and earlier.  The
 complete functionality of POINT can now be accessed easily through the
 keyboard (as well as with the mouse).  In addition to the new user
 interface, many bugs found in the previous versions have been fixed,
 and overall operation has been improved.


 Quick Start
 -----------

 *  To execute POINT, enter "PT" at the DOS prompt.  To load a file,
    press the F2 key to display the file selection screen.  You may
    use the cursor arrow keys (or the mouse), or enter the name of
    the file you wish to edit.  Press the Enter key to load the file.

 *  Notice the highlighted letters in the menus.  These are "speed keys"
    that can be executed by pressing and holding the Alt-key in
    conjunction with the highlighted letter.  For example, the "Files"
    menu has the letter "F" highlighted.  So, in order to view the Files
    menu, simply press "Alt-F".

 *  Inside each menu there are highlighted letters and optional direct
    keys listed to perform each specific command.  For example, notice
    the first entry in the Files menu:

                      "Open File Full      F2"

    The "F" in "Full" is highlighted, indicating that it is the speed 
    key within the menu for performing that command.  The "F2" function 
    key also will perform that command.  The cursor up and down arrow
    keys (in conjunction with the Enter key) may also be used to select
    a command.  So, in this case, from the editor screen, pressing
    "Alt-F-F" (or F2) will open a file into a full screen window.
    Experiment with the different menus and speed keys to get a feel
    for their operation.

 *  The highlighted letters in the file selection screen and the color 
    settings screen operate in the same manner.  For example, pressing 
    "Alt-E" in the file selection screen will execute the "New pattern"
    command.

 *  For context-sensitive help on a particular command or menu, press
    the "F1" function key.  You may now navigate through the help system
    via the menus on each help screen.

 *  Some quick-key commands:

	Esc		- returns you to the current editing screen
			  from any process in POINT

	F3		- saves all the files you currently have on 
			  screen and returns you to DOS

	F10		- abandons all changes you have made to your
			  files and returns you to DOS

	Alt-Q		- lets you choose which files you want to save
			  and which files you want to abandon, and
			  then returns you to DOS
