Thanks to someone's decision that "No one will ever need more than 640k"
there are several different types of memory on our PC's.  The
environment, linker, debugger and compiler all use various types of
memory.
There are basically 3 types of memory that all of our various programs
use.  The amount available of each of these can be found by the dos
"MEM" command.

C:\>MEM

    655360 bytes total conventional memory
    655360 bytes available to MS-DOS
    615376 largest executable program size     <------------------¿
								  |
   1048576 bytes total EMS memory                                 |
   1048576 bytes free EMS memory    <--------------------------¿  |
							       |  |
   7340032 bytes total contiguous extended memory              |  |
         0 bytes available contiguous extended memory          |  |
   1048576 bytes available XMS memory                 <-----¿  |  |
           MS-DOS resident in High Memory Area              |  |  |
							    |  |  |
							    |  |  |
  Ú---------------------------------------------------------Ù  |  |
  À> XMS - This is the memory we need to compile or link in    |  |
           protected mode.  If the compiler or linker gives    |  |
	   you the error message "Not enough memory ..." or    |  |
	   "out of memory" then try increasing this by loading |  |
	   fewer device drivers or decreasing the amount of    |  |
	   EMS you have allocated or decreasing the size of    |  |
	   any disk caches you might have. This type of memory |  |
	   requires that a device driver such as HIMEM.SYS be  |  |
  	   installed.                                          |  |
  Ú------------------------------------------------------------Ù  |
  À> EMS - This is the memory used by the environment and the     |
  	   debugger. If you get the error message "Not enough     |
	   heap for symbol table" or "Not enough heap for module  |
	   table"  then try freeing up some more EMS.  You first  |
	   must make sure that there is an EMS driver installed   |
	   in your CONFIG.SYS file such as EMM386.EXE. Try        |
	   slowly increasing the number on that line to about     |
	   64k.                                                   |
  Ú---------------------------------------------------------------Ù
  À> Conventional DOS Memory - This is the memory used by all of our
	   programs.  If the environment or the compiler will
	   not load or when you try to compile from the
	   environment you get the error message could not load
	   compiler then you don't have enough conventional 
	   memory available.  You can free more conventional 
	   memory by loading high device drivers with the DEVICEHIGH= 
	   instead of the DEVICE= command in your CONFIG.SYS, or 
	   just eliminating the device all together.  If you are 
	   operating form the environment you will want to set the 
	   swap environment switch to yes so that the compiler will 
	   have as much memory as possible.  You can also try loading 
	   dos high by using the DOS,HIGH command in your CONFIG.SYS 
	   file.


     DPMI - When running under 386Max 6.x or Windows 3.x Enhanced mode
          or when running under OS/2 2.x, our extender uses DPMI
	  memory. The DOS mem command does not display this memory.
	  
	  Under 386Max and Windows 3.x all memory can be DPMI memory.
	  Under OS/2 2.x, use your DOS settings to allocate the amount
	  of memory desired for protected mode compiling and linking.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     If you get a "Could not run compiler" error inside the environment,
     this means that there was not enough DOS memory to load the compiler.
     While the compiler can "execute" in protected mode, it must start
     out as a DOS program and must load into DOS memory.
     
     The environment is a DOS program and uses DOS memory. It can use a
     limited amount of EMS memory to store its information on the
     modules that compose a project. This is usually 64k unless you have
     set up your EMS manager to provide more mappable memory.
     
     The environment must have enough memory to load the compiler into
     DOS memory after all modules have been added to the environment. The
     compiler requires roughly 330k to load.
     
     We suggest you have a minimum of 540k free at the DOS prompt before
     running the environment, and have 64k of EMS memory available. More
     DOS memory is better.
