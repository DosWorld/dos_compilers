
	This file describes the new utilities included with Pascal+.
	The source code to these utilities is included as well.
	aka. Batteries are included!


    1. dt.exe

       This is a real simple program. It just displays the
       current date and time. Useful for people who do not wear
       watches like me.

    2. rendir.exe

       This is the command that keeps getting left out of DOS.
       It will rename a directory.

       rendir this tothat

    3. whereis.exe

       This program will find a file on a specified drive. The filename
       can include the DOS wildcard characters. Do not include a path
       in the filename!? The current drive is assumed if a drive is not
       given. If a ? is given for the drive, then all drives >= C: will
       be searched for the file.

       whereis [d:]filename

       whereis fu.bar
       whereis c:fu.bar
       whereis ?:fu.bar

    4. altered.exe

       This program will report all files modified after a specified
       date and time. Up to four paths may be given to search. The
       default date is the current date. The default time is 4:00am.
       Why 4:00am, programmers work late, I do, so midnight was not a
       good choice. The program filters out .INT, .LIB, .OBJ, .EXE,
       .TPU, .BAK and .LST files.

       altered [/Ddate] [/Ttime] paths
       [/Dday | /Dmonth/day | /Dmonth/day/year] /Thour[:minutes][a|p]

       If the date is not supplied, the default, the current date is
       assumed.

       /Dday             assumes the current month and year.
       /Dmonth/day       assumes the current year.
       /Dmonth/day/year. the year is assumed later than 1980 and can be
                         supplied in 2 or 4 digit format.
		         1/2/92 or 1/2/1992.

       /Thour assumes 0 minutes and AM, and the hour is in 12 hour
       format.
       [a|p] a signifies AM and is assumed if not present. p signifies PM.

       altered source
       altered source\*.pas
       altered source inc /t4pm

    5. sweep.exe

       This program will execute any valid COMMAND.COM command in the
       current and all lower directories.

       sweep del *.bak
       sweep whereis fu.bar <- in case you have nothing better to do!

    6. killdir.exe

       This is a dangerous one. It will remove (kill) an entire
       directory tree. You will be prompted, just to make sure you are
       sure. The directory must be in the current directory.

       killdir [/A][/Z] directory

       /A will delete hidden, system and readonly files as well.
       /Z will wipe all files with zeros before deleting them.

    7. search.exe

       A typical text search utility.
       You can search up to four paths for files.
       .INT, .LIB, .OBJ, .TPU, .EXE, .BAK and .LST  files are filtered.
       The search is NOT case sensitive.
       If you want to search for a string with spaces, substitute a \
       character for any spaces to be matched.

       search source fubar
       search source inc hello\world

    8. edpath.exe

       This program allows you to edit the PATH statement in your 
       environment. The existing PATH must be <= 254 characters.

    9. sbdump.exe

       This is the big boy of the bunch.
       It is a formatted file dumper like the TDUMP utility supplied
       with the Turbo Debugger. sbdump will recognize a file type by
       the file extension.

       The following files are recognized by sbdump.
       OBJ and LIB files.
       EXE file header and relocation information.
       Virtual overlay manager overlay information in EXE file.
       CodeView debug information in EXE file.
       Pascal INT files.
       Modula-2 SYM files.
       Hex dumps are performed for any file type.

       sbdump FileSpec [ModuleWanted]

       ModuleWanted will limit a CodeView dump to that module

       Switches can be anywhere on the commandline, but must be
       separated from parameters by spaces. Switches need not be
       separated by spaces from each other.

       /P pauses per screenfull if output is to the screen.

       /H forces a hex dump
       /E forces an EXE dump
       /L forces a Library OMF dump
       /LS dumps various statistics of a LIB file
       /O forces an OMF dump

       /V gives a more verbose listing if available. OMF and EXE
       currently

       /T gives a list of OBJ files and their addresses in a LIB file

       /CV[:[T][S][P][D]] forces a CodeView dump
          T will give Type information only
          S will give symbolic information only
          P will give Public symbol information only
          D will dive the Debug directory only
          L will give line number information only

       /A:address
	  Where address is the starting address in the file to start
	  the dump. Address can be in either hex or decimal.
	  examples

	  23	= decimal number
	  $23	= hex number
	  23h	= hex number
	  23H	= hex number

  10. markwin.exe

      It marks a new executable as Windows 3.x compatible.  Any
      resource compiler also does this, but when using the Windows
      versions of CRT or GRAPH, the resource compiler is not needed and
      the EXE should be marked. This program is executed by the
      environment automatically.

      markwin filespec[.EXE]

  11. lock.exe

      It "locks" an SBL library so that it is protected from somebody
      opening the file and harming the options.

      lock filespec[.SBL]

  12. Cv2Td.exe - no source code included

      This program converts CodeView V3 debug information to Turbo
      Debugger specification 3.0 information. The program only runs in
      protected mode. The program creates a .TDS file with the TD
      information. The CodeView information is left intact in the EXE
      file. The .TDS file is in the same directory as the EXE file and
      has the same name as the EXE file.
