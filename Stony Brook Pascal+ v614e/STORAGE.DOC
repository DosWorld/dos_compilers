	manager you can use with Pascal code. The UNIT name is Storage
	and can be found in the UTIL directory. Complete source code is
	provided, and as such, the source code is considered the bulk
	of the documentation. This heap manager supports all procedure
	calls, and then some, that the Turbo heap manager supports. It
	does not support Mark or Release, although these can be
	simulated. It also does not support the System variables
	pertaining to the heap system.

	This heap manager is the heap manager that all StonyBrook
	products use, except that is was translated to Pascal from
	Modula-2 for your use. This heap manager provides much more
	capability than the Turbo Pascal type heap manager, plus it is
	over 4 times faster on random allocation and deallocation. A
	heap testing program is provided, hrand.pas, and is in the same
	directory as the Storage unit. You can run this program using
	both Storage and the built-in heap to verify about 4.5 times
	execution speed difference.

	Storage is written in an operating system independent fashion,
	and can work for Windows, DOS extender or OS/2, however this
	conditional code was removed during the conversion from
	Modula-2. The procedures OSALLOC, OSDEALLOC, OSAVAIL are the
	functions that are dependent on the system installed. The heap
	manager is compatible with protected mode if the OS functions
	are implemented from the extender being used. The TP compatible
	system cannot function in protected mode.

	This heap system can use UMB or EMS mapped blocks easily since
	it uses discontinuous memory blocks. All that need be done is
	to place these blocks into the heap freelist.

	The heap system starts out with no memory allocated, and
	grows as you request memory. The heap system also has the
	capability to return memory to the OS, thus the heap is
	something like a balloon. Therefore to use this system you will
	have to set the $M heap parameters to zero, so that this heap
	manager can get memory from DOS.

	The heap system also provides the capability to control
	multiple independent heap systems.

	The heap system also allows users linking C code to redirect C
	memory allocation into this heap system where the
	TP compatible system does not. The UNIT PHEAP in the CHEAP
	directory within PPDEMOS helps accomplish this.

	The interface portion of the unit source contains documentation
	on the various functions available.
