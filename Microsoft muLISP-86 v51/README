    This is a summary of muLISP-86 features not yet incorporated into
the Reference Manual:

The file HELP.LSP provides a help facility for muLISP primitives.
After it is read in, commands of the form (HELP name) or (? name)
show <name>'s arguments, primitive type, and page number in
Chapter 5 of the Reference Manual.

The file STRUCTUR.LSP contains a structure facility (DEFSTRUCT) and
an array facility (MAKE-ARRAY, AREF, ARRAY-RANK, ARRAY-DIMENSION,
ARRAY-DIMENSIONS, ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE, and ARRAY-IN-BOUNDS-P).
See the file and Chapters 17 and 19 of Common LISP by Steele for
documentation.

The function DOS, defined in COMMON.LSP, simplifies the calling of
the MS-DOS command processor.  For example:  (DOS "DIR B:/W").

The function GENSYM, defined in COMMON.LSP, creates new symbols.
(GENSYM) returns a new symbol.  If <n> is a nonnegative integer,
(GENSYM n) sets the gensym counter to <n>.  (GENSYM symbol) sets
the gensym prefix to <symbol>.

A "backquote" macro character, defined in COMMON.LSP, facilitates
defining macros using DEFMACRO.  See the file and pages 349-351 of
Common LISP by Steele for documentation.

The functions STRING-TRIM, STRING-RIGHT-TRIM, and STRING-LEFT-TRIM,
defined in MULISP.COM, can now accept either a list or a symbol
as its first argument (in accordance with Common LISP).

The function STACK-LIST, defined in MULISP.COM, returns a list of
the values currently on the muLISP variable stack.

The muLISP editor command  Ctrl-Q L  repeats the last search and
replace command until the end of the text is reached.

If the muLISP editor control variable *CASE-IGNORE* is nonNIL,
case is ignored when searching for a string.

The muLISP editor variable *WINDOW-SHAPE* controls the initial
dimensions of the edit window.  F for full screen, V for vertical
split, H for horizontal split.

A native code compiler for muLISP is now available from Soft
Warehouse, Inc.  Write Soft Warehouse for details.
