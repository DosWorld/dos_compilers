		Notes on patching MS-DOS(R) Version 3.20

Version 3.20 of MS-DOS(R) contains a bug that can cause unexpected results in
programs that use floating-point math. This file explains how to eliminate
that problem by using PATCH87.EXE, a program included in this release.

Note that IBM(R) PC-DOS 3.20 contains another, different floating-point bug.
The README.DOC file for this release tells you where to find more information
about installing a patch for that bug. If you use any version of DOS 3.20
other than IBM PC-DOS 3.20 or MS-DOS 3.20, contact your hardware manufacturer
to determine whether the problem exists in your version.


Do I Need to Use This Program?
------------------------------
You do not need to read any further unless your system has ALL of the following
characteristics:

    1.	You use MS-DOS version 3.20.
    2.	You boot from a hard-disk drive.
    3.	Your system has a math coprocessor (for instance, an 8087 chip).
    4.	You run programs that use floating-point math.

For systems that satisfy all of the preceding conditions, you may be able to
eliminate floating-point math problems by installing a small patch in DOS. If
you are not sure whether you need the patch, perform the following steps:

    1.	Copy the program PATCH87.EXE (included in this release) to the root
	directory of your hard-disk drive.

    2.	Reboot your system from the hard disk and DO NOT PERFORM ANY FLOPPY-
	DISK OPERATIONS after rebooting. It is very important that you avoid
	floppy-disk I/O after rebooting, since that will affect the reliability
	of the diagnostic test that you are about to perform.

    3.	If necessary, use the CD command to move to the root directory of your
	hard-disk drive.

    4.	Run the PATCH87.EXE program by entering this command at the DOS prompt:

	    PATCH87

	The program performs a diagnostic test on your system to determine
	whether it needs the DOS patch, and, if the patch is needed,
	whether it can be performed successfully.

     5. Follow the procedure described in the next section if the program
	tells you that you need to install the DOS patch, and that it can
	be done.

    NOTE: The floating-point problem has been eliminated in versions of
    MS-DOS higher than 3.20. This includes MS-DOS versions 3.21 and 3.30.



If You Need to Install the Patch
--------------------------------
If you performed the preceding test and determined that you should install the
DOS patch on your system, perform the following steps:

    1.	Format a blank floppy disk. (Do NOT use the /s formatting option to
	transfer system files to the disk.)

    2.	Use the SYS command to copy IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS from the root
	directory of your hard disk to the new floppy disk. For instance, if
	you boot from drive C:, you would enter the following commands:

	    C:
	    SYS A:

    3.	Use the COPY command to copy COMMAND.COM and SYS.COM to the same
	floppy disk.

    4.	Use the COPY command to copy the program PATCH87.EXE (included in this
	release) to the same floppy disk.

    5.	Change the current drive and directory to the floppy disk, by entering
	the following command:

	    A:

    7.	Install the DOS patch by entering the following command:

	    PATCH87 /F

	WARNING: If you experience any disk errors during steps 2 through 7,
	do NOT proceed with step 8. Reboot from your hard disk and repeat the
	entire process.

    8.	If you have not experienced any errors, use the SYS command to transfer
	the files IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS from the floppy disk back to your hard
	disk. For instance, if the boot directory of your system is the root
	directory of drive C:, you would enter the following command at the DOS
	prompt:

	    A:
	    SYS C:

	This installs the DOS patch.

    9.	Reboot the system.
