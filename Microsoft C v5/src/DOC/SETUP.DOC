IMPORTANT: This document contains information about using the program
SETUP.EXE to install Version 5.10 of the Microsoft(R) C Optimizing Compiler.
Please read the entire document carefully before attempting to install this
product.


========================< What Is SETUP? >=====================================

The program SETUP.EXE, found on the disk labeled "Setup Disk," can be used to
install the entire compiler and supporting files for Version 5.10 of the
Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler. You can also use it to build additional
combined libraries without repeating the installation process. See "Combined
Libraries" below, and the printed documentation, for more information about
combined libraries.


=======================< Starting SETUP.EXE >==================================

To use the SETUP program, insert the disk labeled "Setup Disk" and go to
the root directory of that disk. Enter a command in the following format:

SETUP [/L]

When you use SETUP to install this product for the first time, you should
invoke SETUP without the /L option. If you use the /L option, SETUP builds
combined libraries but does not copy the Version 5.10 files from the
distribution disks to your disk. See "Building Libraries" below for more
information about using the /L option.


===========================< Using SETUP >=====================================

SETUP is a full-screen interactive program. It asks you several questions
about which files to copy to your hard disk, and where to put those files.
For each question, SETUP supplies a default response enclosed in square
brackets ([]). If the default response is satisfactory, you can choose it
by pressing the ENTER key.

If you want something other than the default response, enter your response
at the cursor. As you type, SETUP checks each character for validity. If you
type an invalid character, SETUP ignores the character and issues a warning
beep. After you enter the response, SETUP checks the entire response for
validity. If the response is invalid, SETUP issues a beep and displays an
error message at the bottom of the screen, giving you another opportunity
to respond.

After you answer all of the questions, SETUP asks whether you wish to change
any of your responses. If you answer by pressing Y, SETUP returns to the
first question. To simplify the process of re-entering information, SETUP
gives your previous response as the default response for each question.
This allows you to move quickly through the list of questions to the response
that you wish to change. You can also use this method to review each of your
responses.


===========================< Setup Options >===================================

Some of the questions that SETUP asks have to do with the memory model(s) and
floating-point method(s) that you plan to use. These subjects are explained in
the printed documentation for this product.

SETUP gives you the option to copy files that eliminate bugs with floating-
point exceptions in IBM(R) PC-DOS 3.20 and MS-DOS 3.20. These files are
explained in the files PATCH320.DOC and PATCH87.DOC, which are included in
this release.

SETUP asks whether it should copy all of the documentation (.DOC) files
in this release onto your hard disk. It is recommended that you do so, since
these files contain important information about this release. The files can
be deleted after you read them.

Before installing this product on a hard-disk system, you should make sure
that your system has enough free space. See the section "Disk-Space
Requirements" below for more information about how much free disk space is
required for various configurations.


========================< Naming Directories >=================================

Once you press N to signal that your responses are correct, SETUP asks you to
name the directories where you want to put the Version 5.10 files. These
include the following directories.

1.  The "binary" directory contains the compiler, linker, and run-time
    modules.

2.  The "library" directory contains C library files, including the combined
    libraries built by SETUP.

3.  The "include" directory contains C include files for both the regular
    C environment and the multiple-thread support library.

4.  The "source" directory contains the Version 5.10 documentation files,
    sample C files, start-up source files, and Microsoft CodeView(R) tutorial.


Note that when SETUP suggests a default response for each of the installation
directories, it uses the first path defined by the PATH environment variable
in your environment.

When providing a directory name, do not give any name that contains a hyphen
(-) character. Using a name that contains a hyphen will create problems when
SETUP builds combined libraries. (The LIB utility interprets the hyphen as
an operator rather than as part of a DOS file name.)

After you finish naming the destination directories, SETUP creates them if they
do not already exist. If you specify an existing directory, SETUP will
overwrite any files that have the same names as files that it copies into
that directory.

Once you have specified all of the directories, SETUP asks if you want to
change any of the directory names. Again, press N to proceed with the
installation process, or Y to change one or more responses. (Note that if you
decide to change the name of a directory that you previously specified, SETUP
does not delete that directory.)

After you press N, SETUP copies files from the distribution disks to your
hard disk, prompting you to insert each floppy disk as needed. It checks
to make sure that you insert the correct disk and displays a message showing
where it copies each file.


========================< Combined Libraries >=================================

After it finishes copying files from the distribution disks, SETUP creates
one or more combined libraries, using the responses you gave concerning the
memory model(s) and floating-point math method(s) that you wish to use.

A "combined library" is a file containing one or more component (individual)
libraries. You can decrease link time dramatically by linking a single
combined library instead of separately linking the component libraries that
it contains.

One of the questions that SETUP asks is whether you wish to delete the
component libraries after SETUP has used them to build the combined library
or libraries that you requested. In most cases you will want to delete the
component libraries, since they occupy significant disk space, and they are
not needed for linking once the combined library exists. After SETUP deletes
component libraries, several non combined libraries remain on your hard disk.
(GRAPHICS.LIB is an example.) Do not delete these remaining libraries; they
are needed by other programs.


=======================< Environment Variables >===============================

The compiler and linker depend on several DOS environment variables to
locate needed files. After you install Version 5.10, you need to set
environment variables so that the compiler can find files in the directories
that you specified when running SETUP. To simplify this process, SETUP
automatically creates a file named NEW-VARS.BAT that contains commands that
set these variables. SETUP places this file in the "binary" directory that
you specified earlier in the setup process.

You may run NEW-VARS.BAT directly as a batch file However, it is easier to
copy the commands from NEW-VARS.BAT into the AUTOEXEC.BAT file in your root
directory. In this way, the environment variables are set automatically
whenever you boot.


=======================< Buffers and Files >===================================

The compiler requires a certain number of buffers and files to operate
efficiently. These parameters are set with the CONFIG.SYS file. SETUP places
the commands needed to select the right number of buffers and files in a
file named NEW-CONF.SYS. Again, this file is placed in the "real-mode binary"
directory that you specified earlier in the setup process.

You should copy the commands from NEW-CONF.SYS into your existing CONFIG.SYS
file (or create a new CONFIG.SYS file if none exists).


===================< Building Libraries (SETUP /L) >===========================

After installing the Version 5.10 files on your hard disk, you may later
decide that you need a different set of combined libraries. One way to
do this is to build the libraries by hand, using the Microsoft Library
Manager (LIB) utility and the list of libraries given in the printed
documentation. A more convenient method, however, is to run SETUP with
the /L option.

If you supply the /L option when invoking SETUP, it creates combined
libraries without repeating the installation process. If you need to
copy files from a distribution disk, SETUP prompts you to insert each disk
as needed, and copies only the files that it needs to create the combined
library that you specify.

In all other respects but for one, SETUP works just as it does when you
install the compiler. That is, it asks you for the memory model and
floating-point method that characterize the combined library you wish to build.
However, SETUP also allows for the possibility that you chose not to delete
the component libraries used to build the original combined library. Thus,
SETUP allows you to specify a directory, not only a floppy disk, as the
source of the component libraries. The source directory can be the same
directory where SETUP places the new combined library.

If you specify a directory as the source of files, and SETUP cannot find
a file that it needs, it prompts you to specify a new directory as the
source. If the needed file no longer exists on your hard drive, you can
specify a floppy disk as the source. Note, however, that once you begin
reading from a floppy disk, you must allow SETUP to obtain all subsequent
files from a floppy disk.


======================< Disk-Space Requirements >==============================

The amount of free disk space needed to install Version 5.10 depends on what
configuration you choose when you run SETUP. This section describes the amount
of disk space needed for several typical configurations.

Minimal Installation
--------------------
Approximately 2.6 megabytes of free space are required to perform a minimal
installation of this product. This includes all documentation files, all
sample programs, all start-up source files, no patch files, no QuickC, and one
combined library.


Minimal Installation With QuickC
--------------------------------
Approximately 2.85 megabytes of free space are required to perform a minimal
installation of this product including QuickC. This includes QuickC and
two combined libraries, with no documentation files, no sample programs, no
start-up source files, and no patch files.


Full Installation
-----------------
Approximately 3.7 megabytes of free disk space are required for a full
installation of this product. This includes QuickC, all documentation files,
all sample programs, all patch files, all startup-source files, and four
combined libraries.


If you choose to retain component libraries after you build combined libraries,
the component libraries for each memory model occupy about 140 kilobytes each.
Another 170-200 kilobytes is consumed by each additional combined library that
you build (this assumes that you do not include GRAPHICS.LIB in the combined
library). About 250-270 kilobytes is required for a combined library that
includes GRAPHICS.LIB.
