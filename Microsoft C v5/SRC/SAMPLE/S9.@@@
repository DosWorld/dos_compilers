The CodeView debugger is a powerful tool for serious debugging.
This tutorial introduces you to CodeView commands using a simple
statistics program.  The tutorial is broken up into four lessons.
Each lesson is fairly short and takes 5 to 10 minutes.  You can
quit by selecting the Q option when you see the main menu.

You control the pace in each lesson. The lessons periodically 
pause and ask you to press the SPACEBAR. Although keystrokes 
and commands are discussed on the screen, you should NOT try 
to type them. The session does this automatically. Just press 
the SPACEBAR.

You can quit in the middle of a lesson by first pressing CONTROL-C 
or CONTROL-BREAK, then pressing the SPACEBAR. The word `break' will 
appear, followed by the CodeView prompt (the greater-than symbol). 
At the prompt, enter `Q' for Quit. The tutorial will end.
