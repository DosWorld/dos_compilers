    Procedure Trace_On;
	--
	-- This routine turns on the printing of the name of each subprogram
	-- as it is entered and exited.
	--

    Procedure Trace_Off;
	--
	-- This routine turns off the printing of the name of each subprogram
	-- as it is entered and exited.  Trace is Off by default.
	--

    Procedure Clear;
	--
	-- Clears the profiling information.  Useful if only a part of the
	-- program is to be profiled.
	--

    Procedure Ignore (name : In String);
	--
	-- The subprogram name is ignored.  No tracing will be done on it,
	-- and it will be treated as if it does not exist.  It will not
	-- show up in charts or print_outs, either.  The name will
	-- be matched exactly, so it should be capitalized, and it should
	-- be the full expanded name of the subprogram (I.e. "IO.OPEN").
	-- Ignores are cleared by Clear.
	--

    Procedure Enter_Part(name : In String);
	--
	-- Name is marked in the profile as if it is a subprogram.
	-- A matching Exit_Part with the same name must be executed
	-- somewhere in the same subprogram as the Enter_Part call.
	-- Remember that all subprograms are profiled automatically -
	-- this routine is only intended to be used to profile parts of
	-- a subprogram.  Use this routine carefully, as a missing exit_part
	-- will screw up the profiler.
	--

    Procedure Exit_part(name : In String);
	--
	-- Mark the exit of a part of a subprogram.  See comments above.
	--
	
    Procedure Print_Profile;
	--
	-- Outputs the current profile.  May be called as often as desired.
	--

    Procedure Chart (which : Chart_types; width : Chart_Width);
	--
	-- Outputs a chart of the current profile for the item which.
	-- May be called as often as desired.
	-- If width = Narrow, an 80 col. chart is produced.  Otherwise,
	-- a 132 column chart is produced.
	-- The output of both chart and print_profile both are written to
	-- Current_Output.  The output can be redirected to a file with
	-- Set_output.
